      From developer to project manager, SharePoint farm owner to business
      analyst, Kevin has done it all and has the hair (or

      lack of) to prove it. Having started in the world of Financial Services
      with delivering solutions on Microsoft technologies to help staff
      collaborate and be more productive, Kevin jumped the fence a few years ago
      to the consultancy side. He has always loved to share and is a Microsoft
      MVP in Microsoft 365 Apps and Services, Viva Explorer and co-hosts the
      weekly modern workplace podcast

      GreyHatBeardPrincess in between his day job as a Group Manager for Modern

      Workplace at Avanade.
