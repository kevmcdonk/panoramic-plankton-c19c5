When working in the digital workplace and making proposals, there are often times where you need to show some content on your site. The go-to content for this has been Lorem Ipsum for quite some time (over 500 years if this article about the [history of Lorem Ipsum](http://www.loremipsum.de/about_lorem_ipsum.html) can be believed) but what about when you want something a little different?

Here are my favourite client friendly versions that work as of March 2018:

## Corporate Ipsum

A splurge of corporate speak like _"Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring."_

## Space Ipsum

One for all the space fans out there ([Andrew Connell](https://twitter.com/andrewconnell) and [Chris Johnson](https://twitter.com/c_f_johnson), I'm looking at you) and want some space based content like _"Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed. As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereΓÇÖs a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest. NASA is not about the ΓÇÿAdventure of Human Space ExplorationΓÇÖΓÇªWe wonΓÇÖt be doing it just to get out there in space ΓÇô weΓÇÖll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who wonΓÇÖt be able to go."_

## Social Good Ipsum

Looking for some socially responsible corporate waffle type content? Look no further than _"Program areas social enterprise transparent collaborate external partners effective replicable. Collaborate thought leadership challenges and opportunities compassion overcome injustice shine. Data issue outcomes; support, and indicators compassion issue outcomes social entrepreneur. Impact investing initiative global, problem-solvers; best practices program areas. The human-centered, policymaker; uplift theory of change capacity building.

## Office Ipsum

Need some content to show meeting notes or client notes for a demo? Office Ipsum has some classics like _"I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer for this was not according to brief. Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution can you make pink a little more pinkish, yet try a more powerful colour. The hair is just too polarising. I trust you. Thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix make it pop I think we need to start from scratch, for we exceed the clients' expectations but we have big contacts we will promote you. Needs to be sleeker the hair is just too polarising, so can it be more retro."_

You can also get the classic Lorem Ipsum from there too.

## The Post Modern Generator

Intriguing generator that creates essays from recursive grammars - a machine learning Lorem Ipsum you could say. _"The main theme of McElwaineΓÇÖs[4] analysis of capitalist
situationism is not theory per se, but posttheory. Lyotard uses the term
ΓÇÿneocapitalist nationalismΓÇÖ to denote the difference between sexuality and
sexual identity. It could be said that the subject is contextualised into a
capitalist situationism that includes truth as a totality."_

## Trollem Ipsum

Finally a more entertaining one designed to generate content to troll other technologies. I included this one purely on the basis that it described Apple lovers as fanboys and Microsoft lovers as apologists. Here's the [Paul Thurrott](https://twitter.com/thurrott) generator: \*"Anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years, on the whole I love Microsoft with all my heart, soon eventually the competition will catch up with Apple nevertheless 2011 is the year for Microsoft, after Netbooks outsold iPads, moreover 2010 is the year of netbooks. They need to fix the iPad, in addition better as a 7ΓÇ¥ model next the Dell DJ is an iPod killer, until no doubt Apple will finally do something about that. Innovative Windows Phone, as well as Apple should close their stores, finally 2011 is the year of Windows Phone prior to they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them on the iPhone 4S is nothing special so as to the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales, in order that Time Machine rips off MicrosoftΓÇÖs Volume Shadow Copy Service.

2012 is the year of the Ultrabook suddenly so-called media tablets."\*
