After a few issues with Google Cloud hosting and mounting costs, I decided to move back to Azure after seeing that you can now host static pages on Azure Storage and use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - post to come on that soon.

For now, here's a cross post from the [Ballard Chalmers](https://ballardchalmers.com) blog series I have been writing on Modern Serverless Development in Azure. The ability to create apps that scale as you need them is so much simpler now but I learnt a few things along the way and so the blog series has been a great way to start to share those.

- [Part 1 - introduction](https://ballardchalmers.com/2018/08/08/modern-serverless-development-part-1-an-application-journey-series/)
- [Part 2 - Data Repository with Cosmos DB and Azure Storage](https://ballardchalmers.com/2018/08/21/modern-serverless-development-part-2-data-repository-with-cosmos-db-and-azure-storage/)
- [Part 3 - Business Logic with Azure Functions](https://ballardchalmers.com/2018/09/24/modern-serverless-development-part-3-business-logic-azure-functions/)

I will update this post as the next in the series of eight is released.
