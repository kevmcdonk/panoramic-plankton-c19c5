      Sharing knowledge and opinions to help others with blogs, links to
      sessions and other community activities
    text: >
      Throughout my career, I have learnt from people like Marc Anderson, Jeremy
      Thake and Andrew Connell - they all shared what they were doing and
      learning. This inspired me to try and share more and help others
      understand the technology, how it could be used, why it should be used and
      what can be done to extend it even further. My aims have been to share
      through blogs, videos and conference presentations, supporting events and
      other communities where I can.


      This page highlights some of those things that I have done, am doing and
      plan to do.

        text: >
          Over in Copenhagen, I joined Zoe Wilson and Chirag Patel in delivering
          a full day workshop around Microsoft Viva with hands-on experience for
          the attendees. This was followed up with a panel session with Zoe and
          Chirag as well as Leslie Crook and beautifully helmed by Sara Fennah.

          The South Coast Summit is a great event that brings the community
          together to share knowledge for free, backed by sponsors and with
          experts giving their time for free. I helped the organisers by
          arranging the productivity and collaboration track, running the Viva
          workshop with Zoe Wilson and Chirag Patel and speaking at three
          different sessions during the main day.
