Your current reaction probably sits in one of three places if you live in the Microsoft space.

- "I'm so excited" - you can't wait for darter and all the benefits it will bring to ease access to information,
- "It's going to be too expensive" -you might be excited about it or not but either way, you just don't think you'll get the budget To get anywhere with it.
- "Erm, what is Cortex?" it may be that you haven't heard about Cortex and the buzz that started at Ignite in 2014 -checkout https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex as a starter or
  listen to our first Grey Hat Beard show

informal knowledge and how can you get access to that knowledge for the right people at the right Time. Much of this will be made easier by Cortex but you can gain huge advantages by implementing some of these suggestions Without Cortex and if you will be
implementing Cortex then you will still need to
plan for many of these things.
