Feedback is great, isn't it? You get to know what people think and you can help improve your service, whether it's a Digital Workplace, custom application or customer services. Getting to know what the users of your service think is vital to making sure you offer a worthwhile service. Feedback should be easy to give and should be simple to be followed up on.

So what about in SharePoint? I love that with SharePoint Online, there is a bold feedback button at the bottom of many of the pages. It doesn't interfere too much and makes it easy when you find something you think could be better.

## So what's the problem?

My issue with this is that the feedback goes straight to Microsoft. While it's great that they get that info, it's not obvious that it is going to Microsoft at all. Most users will think that they are providing some thoughts to their SharePoint team on how the site could be laid out better or maybe a typo on a news article. Instead, they are sending this up to someone who can't actually help with it.They get frustrated that nothing changes and the admins who can help don't get any the wiser.

## But there's a bigger problem...

A helpful staff member has just fed back on a out of date page and shared what the latest info should be. This wings its way on to the user voice survey and is there for the whole world to see. This is private information on a company (a fictional one in the case above in case you hadn't guessed) and should be held so. For the many out there considering GDPR implications, this is a great example.

## Can we do anything about this?

I have raised a [User Voice](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/20072722-send-feedback-to-site-admins-first) request to have feedback sent to admins first - it would be great to build some momentum on it. Feel free to add your feedback in the comments too, naturally!
