On 2 November, I presented virtually at the [Collab 365 Virtual Conference](https://collab365.conferencehosts.com/confs/global2017) on building an intelligent Office Add-In. I will be publishing the video here shortly after the conference but for anyone interested, below are a few of the useful links and info related to the presentation.
