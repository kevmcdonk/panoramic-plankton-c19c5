Thanks to the amazing people at Collab 365, my virtual conference presentation on building an intelligent Office Add-In using Cognitive Services is now available at https://collab365.community/using-cognitive-services-build-intelligent-office-add/. It covers how to build an Add-In for Outlook using the modern tools (good old Yo Office), how to bring in Cognitive Services for sentiment analytics and a little bit of SharePoint Framework at the end.

I always love feedback so please do let me know what you think. All the code is available at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/YouveGotSentiment and other links in [my earlier post](https://www.mcd79.com/using-cognitive-services-to-build-an-intelligent-office-add-in/).
