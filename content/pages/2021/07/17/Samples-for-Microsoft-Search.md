Do you know what Microsoft Search is capable of? It has so many options for Answers but it can often be hard to see samples of this. To help with this, I have created a GitHub repo of search samples that you can use to import and get started faster

## How can you use the search samples?

The search samples are mostly CSV files that can be imported to the admin centre. They have sets of data that can be used to populate a sample tenant with data to demonstrate or explore what is possible. Details of how to import the files, including the Floor Plan file, is in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/kevmcdonk/MSSearch-Samples/blob/main/README.md).

If you want to see how the different values look like, watch my session from Collab Days Barcelona below for demos of the different capabilities.
