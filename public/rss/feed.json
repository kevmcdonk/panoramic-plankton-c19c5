            "content_html": "<p>A few weeks back, I was lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to try out the Lenovo ThinkSmart View, a standalone device dedicated to Microsoft Teams. Many of you may be thinking &quot;erm, why would you want that?&quot; and the simple answer (which I&#39;ll expand on in a minute) is performance. Too many times has Teams rendered my machine unusable and I spend a large chunk of my day in meetings. Would this improve my experience?</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I&#39;ll cover what the device is, why you might need it, a run through of the set up, initial thoughts, longer term and then a wrap up.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the Lenovo ThinkSmart View</h2>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with what the device is. It&#39;s an Android powered device with an 8&quot; LCD, with a camera, speaker and microphone that allows you to offload the running of Teams to a separate device. It has a separate power supply and can run entirely independently of your PC but can also synch up so that you can still share screen on your PC even though the meeting is running on your device.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it is a great looking piece of kit that feels solid with a silky smooth surface and very stable when in either landscape or portrait mode. It includes a manual camera shutter so you can ensure that you are not being watched. For me, the speakerphone capability was hugely useful and like having a conference phone on your desk but you can also connect with bluetooth headsets if you are in a more exposed area like an open plan office.</p>\n\n<p>You can see full details on the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/smart-devices/smart-office/thinksmart/Lenovo-CD-18781/p/ZZISZSCCD03\">Lenovo site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why would you need it?</h2>\n\n<p>For me, the reason I was looking for a device like this was that my Surface Pro 6 often slows down massively when on Teams calls. I will admit that I am a tab hoarder and often have multiple profiles open in the new Edge but the amount of memory that Teams takes up for a call with a number of people on is huge. Too often, I was unable to do things on my PC during a meeting, hugely limiting my productivity.</p>\n\n<p>I also like to have Teams front and centre and having a dedicated device showing a summary of my day and with easy access to chat was something I am keen on. Having a single screen showing your upcoming events while you are working on a document and comparing with a webpage means that you do not miss things coming up, especially if you are focusing and don&#39;t want notifications.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it is a good quality speakerphone meaning that you don&#39;t have to be wearing headphones in meetings all day. Being constricted for long hours really adds to the drain of remote working constantly.</p>\n\n<h2>What was the setup experience like?</h2>\n\n<p>I will be honest that my initial impressions were hugely underwhelming. It only had meetings and calls available and felt very limited. This was surprising and not what I had expected from one of the Teams devices.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, after a little digging, I found <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-microsoft-teams-displays/ba-p/1505437\">this article</a> on Teams Devices and confirmed that it had not been set up as a Teams Device. I logged it into my tenant and then went into the Teams Admin area - if you don&#39;t have access to the Teams Admin area, make sure you know someone who is as this is essential to support the device.</p>\n\n<p>From Teams Admin, I could now upgrade to the latest version and also set it as a Teams Device. It took a few tries at doing this and I found it worked best by making it a scheduled update but later that evening, I finally had the device that I was expecting.</p>\n\n<h2>Initial thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>The interface feels very slick and navigating takes place quickly. As well as having meetings and making calls, you have the ability to access the Teams Hub and can chat with people too. Chat can either be done on the touch screen or you can connect up to your PC and so use your PC keyboard. It&#39;s simple to understand and move between the different features and feels natural doing it.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting area is how it interacts with your PC as well. When sharing screen, you can still connect with the PC client and share your screen from there but as it is not running the video, it uses less RAM there (one of the big reasons I wanted a separate device). It connected simply and worked well, giving that seamless experience.</p>\n\n<p>What about the meeting sound and vision? The quality of the camera is very average and the angle of the device means that you are going to be getting that view of any chins that you have been hoarding during lockdown which isn&#39;t ideal. From the perspective of the person with the device, the audio is just right as a speakerphone but I did hear some comments about the volume of typing on the keyboard so you may need to make liberal use of the mute. The background blur also causes problems and stops the camera working at all in many cases so I decided against using that.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest missing feature I found was tasks as would love to be able to pin my ToDos on the screen as a reminder of what to do that day alongside the calendar itself. Hopefully something that will come soon.</p>\n\n<h2>Longer term</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve now been using the device for a couple of months with the comments above being for the first few days of usage. What are my thoughts now?</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I&#39;ve started using the device less and less. It&#39;s nice to have there for my quick view of upcoming meetings but the quality of the video and audio became more of an issue. I like to be looking at people for meetings and having that separate device when I had content on screen gave off the view that I wasn&#39;t watching too much. The smaller screen was also hard to look at other people&#39;s content and I found myself having to move closer to see, giving people a lovely view of my forehead and not much else.</p>\n\n<p>The link with the PC that I lauded at first soon became less stable and would often not be there, leading me to have to join the meeting twice. This would use just as much RAM on the PC and completely removed the point I was trying to overcome. I would also run Teams as typing on the device was so slow and clunkier than on a phone due to where it was and the angle. Which brings me to the one point that could start me using the device again more.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, the Cortana integration is only available in the US as a preview. To have a standalone device that I could ask when my next meeting was or what tasks I had left to do that day would definitely interest me. Would it work well? I don&#39;t know as I couldn&#39;t find anyway to enable it at all here in the UK. Hopefully this preview will reach a bit further and open up more of that voice control which is great in a home office with no-one to disturb. We&#39;ll see.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>So, the big question - would I recommend this device?</p>\n\n<p>This is a really tricky one. It&#39;s great looking and I enjoyed using it - having that extra screen to see your chats, upcoming meetings and unread Teams messages is nice. Being able to not to have to use headphones and still get a clear sound was great as I have definitely been feeling distant from having headphones on all day long.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&#39;s an expensive device just for these things. What would make it worthwhile is to be able to offload the full use of Teams from the PC and reduce that memory utilisation. For me, it just doesn&#39;t quite do this. The video quality isn&#39;t good enough and I don&#39;t want that up angle nose shot too much. The sharing of the desktop PC screen is too inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>The use of Cortana may tip things back into the firm recommend option but at the moment, I can&#39;t quite justify the cost for what it offers to others. I will be keeping it on my desk for now and keep an eye out for those Cortana updates.</p>\n\n<p>Photo courtesy of me!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Autumn came and went. Christmas and the end of the year came and went. 2021 started but still there was no sign of Project Cortex. Vaccines appeared and hope for an end to the pandemic being in sight. But still no Cortex. No knowledge hubs. What could be wrong? Were there problems? Would we see it happen. Now we know the answer and the answer is Microsoft Viva. And I like it.</p>\n\n<p>This post will introduce Viva and especially Viva Topics, talking about what it is, how you can set it up and my thoughts on using it so far.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is part six of the Knowledge Management series. For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/2020/08/12/knowledge-management-series\">Part One - Introduction</a></li><li><a href=\"/2020/09/10/knowledge-management-series-considering-where-knowledge-is-stored\">Part Two - Considering where knowledge is stored</a></li><li><a href=\"/2020/09/14/knowledge-management-organising-knowledge\">Part Three - Organising knowledge</a></li><li><a href=\"/2020/09/17/knowledge-management-series-creating-a-culture-of-knowledge\">Part Four - Creating a culture of knowledge</a></li><li><a href=\"/2020/09/26/knowledge-management-series-introduction-to-sharepoint-syntex\">Part Five - An introduction to SharePoint Syntex</a></li></ul></blockquote>\n\n<h2>What is Microsoft Viva?</h2>\n\n<p>Before I describe Viva Topics, I should cover what Microsoft Viva is but there are two answers to this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>For the vast majority of people, it is an Employee Experience Platform (EXP) that puts in place everything an employee will need from being onboarded, getting the latest information and learning key knowledge for your role.</li><li>For those that follow Microsoft 365 closely, it can appear as a collection of announcements that had already been made given a flashy new name.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The reality is a bit of both. The services <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/overview\">announced by Satya Nadella</a> had mostly been mentioned before but the beauty of Viva is the simplicty of the messaging. It is not about the underlying technology (impressive as that is) but what it enables for employees and the consistency that it should bring about. Thankfully, someone who can explain this far more eloquently than me has already done so I highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshbersin.com/2021/02/the-massive-market-impact-of-microsoft-viva/?utm_sq=gnc2jj2w0o\">Josh Bersin&#39;s article</a> on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/02/04/microsoft-viva-empowering-every-employee-for-the-new-digital-age/\">four pillars</a> that form Viva with Viva Connections, Viva Learning, Viva Insights and Viva Topics - today, I&#39;ll be focusing on the last pillar.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Viva Topics?</h2>\n\n<p>If you have been following my <a href=\"/2020/09/03/Knowledge-Management-Series.html\">Knowledge Management Series</a>, you will know that I have been excited about Project Cortex and what it was going to offer. <a href=\"/2020/09/26/Knowledge-Management-Series-Introduction-to-SharePoint-Syntex.html\">SharePoint Syntex</a> whet my appetite with some AI goodness but the knowledge hubs that I saw were really what I wanted. The ability to easily share common phrases and have those be easily linked to from across Microsoft 365 were something that would truly enable the sharing of topics. Viva Topics is the released name for exactly that.</p>\n\n<p>On setup, you are given a Topic Centre where you can curate the topics to be shared. Each topic has its own page where you can describe the topic, add experts, related files and pages and then other linked topics. Simply, it&#39;s the central place to find information on that topic.</p>\n\n<p>Could it just be a standard page? Yeah, it probably could be. But Topics will become much more. They will soon start showing up in other Microsoft 365 services, starting with SharePoint, where any point that the topic is written will show as a link back to that hub. Sadly, this isn&#39;t in place yet but will start rolling out through the year.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting started with Viva Topics</h2>\n\n<p>One of the things that I have heard a few times just after the announcement was that it was not obvious how to get started. I put this up quickly on Twitter in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk/status/1357377802320949248?s=20\">TweetStream</a> but to keep things easier to find, here are the steps to take.</p>\n\n<h4>Get a license (or trial license)</h4>\n\n<p>The quick link is to go to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/BuyVivaTopics\">the request page from Microsoft</a>. Otherwise, from the <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal\">Microsoft 365 Admin Centre</a>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Click on Billing then Purchase Services</li><li>Click on View Products</li><li>Scroll to Add-Ons and click on Show All</li><li>Select Topics and Start Trial or add a license</li></ul>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nzvVCEVCXY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<h4>Assign license to yourself and others who need it</h4>\n\n<p>When you have the licenses:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Head to the Admin Centre home page</li><li>Click on Users then Active Users</li><li>Select the user to get the license</li><li>Click on the &quot;Licensing and Apps&quot; tab</li><li>Select the &quot;Topic Experiences&quot; license</li><li>Click on Save</li></ul>\n\n<h4>Set up Topics</h4>\n\n<p>Once you have at least one license assigned to yourself, return to the Admin Centre and select Setup from the menu.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Scroll down to Files and Content</li><li>Click on the &quot;Connect People to knowledge&quot; link</li><li>Follow the wizard with your preferred set up</li><li>Wait a few mins for it to complete</li></ul>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOMGm6z98Gk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Since I put the video together, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CraigHumphrey\">Craig Humphrey</a> (apologies if it was a different Craig!) noted via the Microsoft 365 Partner Network that you can also:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Head to the Admin Centre home page</li><li>Click Settings then Org Settings</li><li>On the Services tab, scroll down to Topic Experiences</li></ul>\n\n<h4>Starting to create topics</h4>\n\n<p>As part of the setup wizard, you will be asked to create a Topic Centre which by default is at /sites/TopicCentre. If you forget where it&#39;s created, you can also navigate from the Settings-&gt;Org Settings-&gt;Topic Experiences mentioned just above.</p>\n\n<p>In the new Topic Centre, there is an easy link to add a new Topic Page as well as a Getting Started tab that points you to three useful links:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/your-knowledge-network-in-microsoft-365-53620e12-ae00-4523-87cf-e935ae77d541?ns=spostandard&amp;version=16&amp;syslcid=1033&amp;uilcid=1033&amp;appver=spo160&amp;helpid=csi_topiccenter_getstarted_intro&amp;ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us\">Intro to Knowledge Network</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/knowledge/topic-experiences-discovery-curation\">Understanding topic discovery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/knowledge/manage-topics\">Manage Topics</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>As you can see in the video below, creating a Topic Page is easy. You add a title, descriptions, some key people who are the experts, key pages and documents and finally how the topic links to other topics in a beautiful graph style chart.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvmbYruNBLA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<h2>Topics - a few thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>I have only been trying this out for a few hours so far but I have a few initial thoughts, positive and negative.</p>\n\n<h4>The good parts</h4>\n\n<p>Getting started is easy. In a few minutes, I had a Topic Centre and it only took five minutes to create a set of topics. I started with Power Platform and easily created linked topics for Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents. From our demo environment, I had some samples that I also created topics for and linked to those demo pages.</p>\n\n<p>The Topic Centre neatly displays all those Topics that you have created with summary cards for each, showing recent activity and whether it is a curated Topic (i.e. defined by a person) or a discovered one (i.e. discovered by AI but not yet validated by a real person). The Topic Pages can be edited with your own web parts as well so they aren&#39;t fixed and can flex to what you need which is really useful.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Topic Centre\" src=\"/images/2021/02/Viva Topics Topic Centre.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>The other great part now available in topics is that they show up in Microsoft Search. No need to create a separate bookmark in Answers, it appears as a card already with the key people and resources shown by default and a link to the Topic Page</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Topics in Search\" src=\"/images/2021/02/Topics in Microsoft Search.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<h4>The potentially bad parts or hopefully just the &quot;not yet there parts&quot; (at least at the time of writing)</h4>\n\n<p>It&#39;s easy to get carried away with these new technologies and become over excited with the good stuff so I always like to include a bit of a grumble. Often, these turn out to either be wrong or resolved pretty quickly. What has raised flags to be in Viva Topics:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Creating links between Topics only seems to exist on a single page so far - I am hoping that this is just the suggestions not kicking in yet but I found it a bit frustrating.</li><li>It is not clear how Managed Metadata will play a part in this or even if it will - it would be good to understand whether to invest time in both or go down one path.</li><li>The highlighting of Topics on other pages and in emails that was talked about with Cortex is not there yet but <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/introducing-microsoft-viva-topics/ba-p/2107007\">will be coming later this year</a>.</li><li>Something I want to see more of is the suggestions which don&#39;t really show up in a demo environment - hopefully I will be adding this to our main tenant at CPS soon and will see more coming through of value.</li><li>At the moment, there is no programmatic access to Topics, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk/status/1357471161462980617?s=20\">via Graph</a> or any other APIs - I suspect this will appear soon and with <a href=\"https://register.ignite.microsoft.com/\">MS Ignite</a> on the horizon, there seems a good point for more to be shared.</li><li>You need to think about the licensing for this as it is an add-on but I am hoping to cover this in a future post.</li></ul>\n\n<p>So the only bad points I have found so far appear to be things that will be addressed. Otherwise, this feels like a very powerful way to curate knowledge in an organisation and get that in front of people at the right time. The latter part is coming soon but that shouldn&#39;t stop you determining what your topics will be and moving those topics from Managed Metadata potentially.</p>\n\n<p>I am planning a few more posts as I invest a bit more time to investigate a bit deeper so keep an eye out.</p>\n\n<p>Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@davidsonluna\">D A V I D S O N L U N A</a> via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com\">Unsplash</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I have been a little quiet on this blog recently and while the stress of the pandemic with lots of kids at home has played into that, another large part has been a painful migration project. I have learnt plenty about the scales of SharePoint Online and reminding myself of the limitations of SharePoint 2010 - I really had forgotten how painful it was considering servers! One of the biggest areas though has been the validation. While the migration tooling gives us some information, we have been running lots of PnP PowerShell scripts for both creating structures and also validating that content has migrated correctly. Having tens of thousands of sites and libraries brings its own challenges.</p>\n\n<p>This weekend I found a great improvement to things. Instead of just using PnP PowerShell, I decided to use REST calls and focus them on particular things. PnP PowerShell is fantastic but it does everything and there are often times where speed is the important factor, not scale. Reducing the amount of data returned and only returning what you need can have huge benefits.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that hasn&#39;t changed is the use of a database to track what has run and what hasn&#39;t. Being able to re-run a script at any point and know that it will pick up where it left off has meant that the age old challenges of servers rebooting in the middle of the night mean there is less impact with being able to start again.</p>\n\n<h2>So what does the script do?</h2>\n\n<p>The script I was working on most recently was aimed at checking that everything was in place ready for handover. It checked a set of libraries for:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Check library is hidden</li><li>Check Minor Versions disabled</li><li>Check search is disabled</li><li>Check title is set correctly</li><li>Check ContentTypes exist</li><li>Check default content type set</li><li>Check list specific field added to content types</li><li>Check fields set to correct required fields</li><li>Check field order set</li><li>Check views set</li></ul>\n\n<p>You may wonder why some of these things are in there (a list specific field added to each content type?) but I&#39;ll save that chat for when we can meet for a coffee/beer/whisky. The challenges with some of these were that the migrated content was in a different state to what we wanted in a few cases which added to the fun.</p>\n\n<h2>How did the original script work?</h2>\n\n<p>For working with the database, I made use of a few scripts that you can find with a quick Google:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PowerShell/blob/master/Out-DataTable.ps1\">out-table.ps1</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/suntong/lang/blob/e7bd7a35690ec89cadee39d21ebb8d921854534d/lang/PowerShell/Examples/Db/Write-DataTable.ps1\">write-datatable.ps1</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/falkheiland/CommonTools/blob/dfcd4c5fc3b8703a19f72291c69a7d1e4ff31b4e/CommonTools/Public/Invoke-Sqlcmd2.ps1\">Invoke-SqlCmd2.ps1</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>Big thanks to Chad Miller who I think was the originator of most of these.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I update the database to say that the library being worked on is started:</p>\n\n<p><code>SQL\nInvoke-Sqlcmd2 -ServerInstance “SQLVM1” -Database “MigrationReporting” -Query &quot;UPDATE LibraryLineage SET ValidationStarted=&#39;$((Get-Date).ToString(&quot;dd MMM yyyy hh:mm:ss&quot;))&#39; WHERE LibID=$libID&quot; -erroraction Stop\n</code></p>\n\n<p>I retrieve the main list details with Get-PnPList based on the url path (mostly because the name had some details that was more compled but you could use name too).</p>\n\n<p><code></code>`PowerShell\n$list = Get-PnPList -Identity $libID -erroraction Stop\n$itemCount = $list.ItemCount</p>\n\n<h1>Check list is hidden</h1>\n\n<p>if ($list.Hidden -eq $true) {\n    $isHidden = 1\n}\nelse {\n    $isHidden = 0\n}\n<code></code>`</p>\n\n<p>With this, you see that I have a variable that I will use at the end to track all the right things are set. I had similar checks for minor versions being enabled and whether the search crawl was disabled.</p>\n\n<p>The most painful part for performance was to get the ContentTypes details for the list.</p>\n\n<p><code>PowerShell\n$listCTs = Get-PnPContentType -List $libID\n</code></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure why this was quite so painful either but something I may dig further into the PnP code.

This also formed the basis of the fix scripts that could see what was wrong and only check those records.</p>\n\n<p><code></code>`PowerShell\n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO [dbo].[LibraryCheck] ([LibID],[ItemCount],[IsHidden],[IsMinorVersionsEnabled],[IsNoCrawl],[IsTitleSet],[DefaultCTExists]&quot;\n$query += &quot;,[SecondCTExists],[ThirdCTExists],[DefaultCTIsFirst],[DefaultCTContainsRR],[SecondCTContainsRR],[ThirdCTContainsRR],[DefaultCTFieldOrderCorrect]&quot;\n$query += &quot;,[SecondCTFieldOrderCorrect],[LinkCTFieldOrderCorrect],[MNumberValid],[PNumberValid],[ProtectiveMarkingValid],[DateReceivedValid],[DocumentStatusValid]&quot;\n$query += &quot;,[AESCRDocTypeValid],[AESCRRestrictedReasonValid],[WCCSubjectValid],[ViewValid]) &quot;\n$query += &quot;VALUES ($mNumber,$itemCount,$isHidden,$minorVersionsEnabled,$isNoCrawl,$titleSet,$defaultCTExists&quot;\n$query += &quot;,$secondCTExists,$thirdCTExists,$defaultIsFirst,$defaultCTContainsRR,$secondCTContainsRR,$thirdCTContainsRR,$defaultFieldOrderCorrect&quot;\n$query += &quot;,$secondFieldOrderCorrect,$thirdCTFieldOrderCorrect,$libIdValid,$fieldOneValid,$fieldTwoValid,$fieldThreeValid,$fieldFourValid,$viewValid)&quot;</p>\n\n<p>$query\nInvoke-Sqlcmd2 -ServerInstance “VMWP-SPMIGSQL1” -Database “MigrationReporting” -Query $query\n<code></code>`</p>\n\n<p>So I had a script that analysed each of my libraries well but the problem was how long it took. On average, I was seeing each library take 33 seconds which on its own was ok, but for 65k libraries was going to be a problem. Running on a single server would take 24.8 days just to get a list of what was wrong. Even running across 10 different servers, I was looking at 2.5 days. This was not ideal.</p>\n\n<h2>A little investigations and refactoring</h2>\n\n<p>The first steps were to see what was taking so long. I stepped through the code and could see that the calls for Get-PnPContentType took 10-12 seconds quite often. Retrieving the list of fields was pretty slow too. I did a little testing to see if I could retrieve the fields using -Includes as well on the Get-PnPContentType call but it made the main call slower and didn&#39;t add any performance benefits.</p>\n\n<p>My initial inclination was to rework the PowerShell to use direct CSOM calls to see if that would be faster. The logic was that I could just do what I needed to do for my code whereas the PnP calls may be doing a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>Instead though, I started with something simpler (for me at least). When I was checking things, I would often use REST calls to check on details for a particular list which got me thinking that I could try these calls. PnP PowerShell has a lovely function called Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod that allows you to make REST calls. With these, I swapped out all the calls I was making with PnP functions with this. I moved most of them to the top of the script and was able to leave the majority of the rest of the code in place.</p>\n\n<p><code>PowerShell\n$list = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)&quot;\n$listCTs = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/ContentTypes&quot;\n$listFields = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/Fields&quot;\n$allDocsView = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/Views?`$filter=Title%20eq%20%27All%20Documents%27&quot;\n</code></p>\n\n<p>I needed to make some changes to the foreach loops but the SchemaXml field contained the fields for the ContentTypes so I could reduce the number of calls made.</p>\n\n<p><code></code>`PowerShell\nforeach($listCT in $listCTs.value) {\n    $listCTSchema=&quot;&quot;\n    $listCTSchema  = [xml]$listCT.SchemaXml</p>\n\n<p><code></code>`</p>\n\n<p>To retrieve certain fields, I could make use of a little bit of XPath from that schema XML. Retrieving these details then no longer required any additional calls to the server.</p>\n\n<p><code></code>`PowerShell</p>\n\n<h1>Check related records added to content types</h1>\n\n<pre><code>    $rr = $listCTSchema.SelectSingleNode(&quot;/ContentType/Fields/Field[@DisplayName=&#39;Related Records&#39;]&quot;)\n\n    if ($rr -ne $null) {\n        $defaultCTContainsRR = 1\n    }\n\n    $fieldLinks = $listCTSchema.SelectNodes(&quot;/ContentType/Fields/Field&quot;)</code></pre>\n\n<p><code></code>`</p>\n\n<p>With these in place, the average time reduced from 33 seconds down to a little over 2 seconds. Running on a single server could be down in 1.5 days or just over 3.5 hours across 10 servers. Not bad at all. Now to see if updating the fix scripts will speed things up too!</p>\n\n<p>Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rodlong\">Rod Long</a> via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com\">Unsplash</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Have you heard, the Immersive Reader is now available to use with pages on SharePoint Online as part of Microsoft 365 so that you can improve the accessibility of content to readers of news and other content in your tenant. In this post, I will cover the importance of the Immersive Reader and what it can do for your users.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the Immersive Reader is important</h2>\n\n<p>Over the years, I have had many conversations with clients looking at SharePoint and wanting to know how they can make their Intranets accessible. Many want to help ensure that all staff can access the content, regardless of any reasons why they physically or mentally may not be able to. From screen readers to considering how readable different colours are next to each other, there is plenty that can be done. SharePoint itself meets the WCAG 2.1 AA international standard in all it does but it doesn&#39;t actually make your own content in SharePoint compliant with that.</p>\n\n<p>So up to now, there hasn&#39;t been any tool to really assist with accessibility in SharePoint but this month, Microsoft has released the Immersive Reader to SharePoint pages. This feature has been available in the Office suite and Teams for a little while but now makes it into SharePoint too. This gives users the ability to view pages in a much easier to read way, with control to increase font size, select easier to read fonts and change the background colours. These all help cater to many needs for making it easier to read.</p>\n\n<h2>Using the Immersive Reader</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader1.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Getting started with the reader is easy as it appears at the top of the page for any reader of a page. There is no need to turn it on, it is enabled by default. Clicking on the link brings up an easy to use page with the content simplified to be easier to read with more spacing between the words and each word highlighted as it progresses.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader2.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>While the default options put the text into a simpler and more spread out state, not all accessibility needs are the same so the Immersive Reader provides additional options on the right to format how the text is rendered. Clicking on the Text option shows the options related to the text.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader3.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>As you would expect, you can easily change the font size but you can also increase the spacing between the words and pick a font that is easier to read. There are a set of ore-determined themes available for the font background to assist those who may find black on white not easy to focus on.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader4.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>In the highlighting wizard section, you can choose types of words to highlight, assisting those with more cognitive needs such as dyslexia. This can highlight types of words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs to make the content easier to understand.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader5.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>The last option provides ways to change the focus for the lines, a dictionary with pictures to help understanding of workds and finally the ability to translate the content too.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader6.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Back in the main window, you can then get the content played out loud to listen to with each word highlighted as it goes along, making things easier to understand.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Accessing the Immersive Reader\" src=\"/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader7.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, and you can control the volume too so if you just want to have the highlighting then, well, you can.</p>\n\n<h2>Supporting accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>Immersive Reader is a great step towards making SharePoint content open to as many people as possible. It allows access to most pages (sadly not the homepage at this time) and makes reading of content easier. Hopefully this is a first step towards making content reviewed to meet <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps\">accessibility requirements for public sector bodies</a> in the UK and it will one day be easier to flag content to content providers that they need to update. Office already has some great tools that do this for PowerPoint and also in Power Platform so fingers crossed that things will be the same in SharePoint soon.</p>\n\n<p>Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ratushny\">Dmitry Ratushny</a> via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com\">Unsplash</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>On 15th and 16th September, I spoke at my first in-person conferin almost two years and it was so incredible to be back with real people. The organising team have been through so many rollercoasters with this conference so seeing everything come together was so so heart warming. Here are my key takeaways from the event.</p>\n\n<h2>It is all about the people</h2>\n\n<p>I know quite how much Mark, Randy, Martin and Phillips have put into this event but if you were there and didn’t know, Mark welling up during the opening speech would have told you all you need to know. Most importantly, it was worth it. The beaming smiles and looks of awe as people took the escalator up to registration while looking down over generations of Mercedes was a sight to behold. People were enthusiastically chatting the sponsors and each other, having been starved of interaction for the last 18 months. Naturally there were still some folks who were hesitant but the goodwill kept everyone going.</p>\n\n<p>What was clear from when I arrived the night before at the speakers event was that people were just so happy to be interacting with real people. They had depth and not just a 2D screen! I will admit that I was a little nervous that people I had only met online would not be always as engaging in real life but I was completely wrong. Everyone was friendly, open and embracing and it really showed what a strong community it is.</p>\n\n<p>It also showed why we do things like this. Sharing to others and seeing that interest is what keeps us all going. To all the attendees, a heartfelt thank you.</p>\n\n<h2>Hybrid can work</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most interesting aspects for me though was how well the hybrid aspect worked. There were some technical difficulties that were soon ironed out but I attended several talks where the presenter was remote. It didn&#39;t feel too different to the in-person sessions and you could tell that the presenter could see people there. It meant that we had a much broader range of speakers, especially those internationally based who could still present.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth saying that it was better when the presenter was there in person and you could get the better connection with them or ask a quick question afterwards. However, the options are there for remote presenting and attending and I like the fact that people have choice. That can only be a good thing in this case.</p>\n\n<h2>Viva is definitely a hot topic</h2>\n\n<p>While many of these session titles were decided in the days just after Viva was announced, it was intriguing how many of the sessions referenced Viva even where it wasn&#39;t the main subject. It shouldn&#39;t have been a big surprise but it was still good to see the interest among the presenters and the good audience for the dedicated Viva sessions shows that there is definitely interest from attendees to know more.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, there weren&#39;t that many vendor offerings that went big with the Viva branding but I suspect that it is still early days for that. The LMS apps on show generally hadn&#39;t defined their Viva Learning plans and the Contact Centres aren&#39;t yet talking Viva Topics. It was a Teams focused conference so there was more about the hardware on show but it will be interesting to see how this plays out at other events.</p>\n\n<p>Talking of hardware...</p>\n\n<h2>There&#39;s some pretty cool devices out there</h2>\n\n<p>One thing that I was particularly interested in seeing was the new devices on show. While a blog post or video is nice, being able to see the actual things and be able to glance around makes a big difference and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. The new Bose UC headphones were simply gorgeous and did make me want to drop my QC35s a few times to give me an excuse. The Polycom solutions that would work for home office were very interesting and I can see a future in the lower end home devices to go along with the even more impressive Teams Room devices. I shouldn&#39;t forget to mention some of the Jabra headsets either with the Evolve 2 catching my attention with it&#39;s foldaway boom mic.</p>\n\n<p>It was the cleverer devices that stole the show with AI powered cameras that could isolate each individual in a Teams meeting to give that real hybrid feel. Also the HoloLens2 and Magic Leap that Simply Videos had on display for having augmented reality meetings gave me food for thought. At one point, I saw one of their reps walking around with a headset and giving a commentary on the F1 cars at Mercedes Benz World - peak Commsverse!</p>\n\n<h2>Governance and reporting are still important</h2>\n\n<p>A surprise I had was how popular the sessions on governance and reporting were. These are really important for Microsoft Teams but it was telling to see the number of people attending the sessions. For me, this shows that the quick move to Teams now needs to be followed up with better governance to keep things working well and not just letting the sprawl happen.</p>\n\n<h2>Thank you to all the organising team</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, I can&#39;t finish without saying a massive thanks to Mark Vale, Martin Boam, Randy Chapman and Phillipa Digby for the incredible event that they put on. The heart that they put into things to make sure there was great food, brilliant swag, engaging speakers, intriguing sponsors and just the best venue showed their passion for the community. Without people like those four, we would not be able to have anywhere near the fun and interest we have.</p>",

Now Microsoft has made quite a few acquisitions over the years but what was interesting about this one was that it announced as the service that would power the next Viva module. It had been heavily hinted that the first four pillars (Connections, Topics, Insights and Learning) would not be the last ones and here it is, the focus for the next release.</p>\n\n<p>Ally.IO focuses on OKRs or Objective and Key Results which are ways to track the aims of an organisation from the top and connect those to the objectives of the employees. It fits with Microsoft Viva as employees feel more engaged when they understand their purpose within an organisation, understand what they need to do to help an organisation succeed. Ally.IO supports this by making clear that alignment from top to bottom and also help make it clear what employees need to do to succeed themselves. Purpose and empowerment are two of Glint&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.glintinc.com/blog/the-elements-of-people-success/\">elements of people success</a> and helps to form the full Employee Experience Platform from Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog, I&#39;ll run through my initial experiences with the trial that you can set up from the <a href=\"https://ally.io/\">Ally.IO site</a>. If you would like more info on what OKRs are and how they fit in the world of Performance Management, Josh Bersin has a great post about it on his <a href=\"https://joshbersin.com/2021/10/microsoft-doubles-down-on-viva-employee-goals-with-ally-acquisition/\">blog site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n\n<p>The place to get started is by signing up for a trial on the <a href=\"https://ally.io/\">Ally.IO site</a>. At the time of writing, you can get a 14 day trial from the main site ahead of the full pricing of $7 per user per month.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Set up a trial\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-01.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Once set up, having validated your email, you are guided to follow a tour for setting up things from the start. The platform is easy to use and easy to understand from the off. As well as the tour, you are given recommended next steps to get moving, including how to build your objectives.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Getting started\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-02.png\"/><img alt=\"Guide on what to do next\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-03.png\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Starting with objectives</h2>\n\n<p>The aim is to get started with your objectives at an organisation level, aligning those to your company purpose. A big obvious button called New Objective guides the new user on how to get going. A slide out panel on the right gives an obvious set of properties to fill out.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Adding an objective\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-04.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Some people may be unsure about the sort of objectives to get started with so there is a set of sample objectives to give you a nudge on the sort of thing to add. These are grouped together into different types of objectives for different departments.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Sample objectives\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-05.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>The magic then starts when you can add more linked to this objective:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Parent objective</li><li>Child objectives</li><li>Key results</li><li>Projects</li></ul>\n\n<p>The key results add the focus of having real measures to align to your objectives. These can be set manually or linked up to other systems such as Azure Dev Ops, Excel Online, Github, Jira and many more. This links up your goal to the systems that you use, to the systems where the work you are doing takes place.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Key results as manual or from a system\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-07.png\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Where does the Microsoft bit come in?</h2>\n\n<p>OK, you may be looking and wondering why Microsoft decided to bring this in. Ally.IO actually already has some integration and not just with the Key results mentioned above. It can bring your OKRs and your organisations OKRs into your flow of work, right there in Microsoft Teams (or Slack or Discord or a few others).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Integrations\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-08.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>For Teams, the integration brings an app that can be pinned like other Teams Apps and shows you the OKRs for you and for the org. These tabs can be added to your own teams as well as the main app so you could even have your department&#39;s objectives aligned with your department team.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Integrations\" src=\"/images/2021/10/AllyIO-09.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>Not only that but you can also chat to the bot if you want to...well...it just seems to link to the OKRs at the moment but hopefully this will expand!</p>\n\n<h2>My thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>These are my thoughts after a few hours of playing around with the trial so these opinions may change. I have tried using OKRs with my team at previous organisations but never had the tools in place to make it happen. The magic here is that alignment from top to bottom and to have it data driven as well. Connecting in with your different systems to be metric driven for your objectives and to make it easier to get those as consistent results.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing in a system to track these makes it far more likely that people will engage on a regular basis. This isn&#39;t about that forgotten set of notes that is only reviewed once a year at a rushed appraisal, this is about regular updates linked to what you do on a day to day basis. This will connect up to the wider purpose of an organisation and connect those together from top to bottom.</p>\n\n<p>If I had a small grumble, the cost of $7 per user for a system that could only be used on an occasional basis and so may scare some off, especially for larger scales. Hopefully a better link up with the other Viva licenses if it comes will improves this.</p>\n\n<p>The platform is simple to use and already works in Teams so will align well with the other Viva pillars. There are also key integrations with other services, both Microsoft and third party ones, once again like the other Viva pllars. It fills a gap in the EXP and so should be seen as another great enhancement for organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brady_bellini?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Brady Bellini</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com\">Unsplash</a>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>“In 2022, a crack community unit was sent to Microsoft for some contracts that they couldn’t commit. These people promptly got together, not escaping from Teams, to explore the world of Microsoft Viva. Today, still wanted by the community they serve, they survive as collaborators of fortune. If you have an employee experience problem, if no-one else can help and, wherever you can find them…maybe you can hear from the Viva Explorers.”</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the great mind of Lesley Crook (and with apologies to the A-Team), a group of community minded people has come together to help you understand the world of Microsoft Viva. You can read the tale on the <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-community-blog/join-vivaexplorers-in-an-empathic-hybrid-workplace/ba-p/3280353\">Tech Community blog</a> but this post is about the part that I play - the Viva Transformer.</p>\n\n<p>Transformation is such a key part of any journey to new ideas and employee experience with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a> is no different. Turning on the technology is only part of the story and in this post, I will talk about some of the high level areas to consider when helping to transform the organisation with adoption and change management. In my current role as head of practice for modern workplace at CPS, we always include change and adoption plans so that we know that things will be of benefit and understood by staff. So what do you need for rolling out Viva at your organisation?</p>\n\n<h2>Start with Why</h2>\n\n<p>So you’ve decided that you are rolling out Viva. Great, good plan. Except you might have missed something. Have you worked out why? Not only that but have you backed up that reason by speaking with staff? Can you align the different areas within Viva specific challenges that have been raised by employees? This is where you need to start.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have an annual staff survey or are taking pulse surveys with a tool like <a href=\"https://www.glintinc.com/blog/an-employees-guide-to-glint-surveys/\">Glint</a>. You may already have some insight into the challenges being faced. You may have a very vocal employee forum or be taking feedback from regular town halls. Make sure that this feedback is broad and caters for the introverts and quieter personalities in your organisation as well as the louder voices that often emerge. Take some of the key points and make sure that you drill a little deeper to make sure that you are getting to the right root of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>One way to consider these is to construct these into areas around the employee lifecycle. The lifecycle starts as soon as someone starts looking at a company, moves through hiring and the all important onboarding. It considers how you engage people with the organisation and each other, putting in place all that people need to perform and allow them to grow within the organisation. Finally, there will always be a point where people depart and considers how you ensure a good farewell that leaves a lasting impression to pass on to others or to encourage a return one day.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Employee Lifecycle\" src=\"/images/2022/04/EmployeeLifecycle.jpeg\"/></p>\n\n<h2>What do you implement?</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to implementations for the Employee Experience, much depends on what you are implementing. The Viva Explorers will be sharing plenty on how to implement Viva with the technical details so in this post I’m going to consider more what you need to transform. If you are have followed the whys above, you have a great backlog of items but what do you do first? What is the priority?</p>\n\n<p>To establish these, the first thing to set up is an Employee Experience Working Group. These will have a group of key stakeholders that can drive change from the top along with key implementers which can make that change happen. There are many ways to implement these that I will go into in future blog posts but some of the key elements are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>• Transparent views for the whole organisation around what is being done\n• Mechanisms for feedback to be taken and addressed\n• Agreement on how priorities are determined\n• Clear guidance on current priorities</code></pre>\n\n<p>There will often be a lot of different areas that need addressing at once but either not enough budget or not enough time to address all at once. Clearly tracking and agreeing the priorities helps employees understand what is coming and can also help to manage the amount of change in one go. It provides a consistent message to employees and helps deliver to completion.</p>\n\n<h2>How do you know you have succeeded?</h2>\n\n<p>Implementing initiatives to improve the employee experience is great but only if they succeed in improving the experience. Having clear criteria for success and KPIs to measure how close to that enables clear and transparent goals that all can see. These will keep all involved but also help to keep the organisation focused on delivering those goals.plus, the great news is that Viva has ways to help you with this.</p>\n\n<p>Through <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/introduction\">Viva Insights</a>, you can look at evidence based measures to support your initiatives. Looking to reduce burnout for staff? Look at hours spent outside of core hours or percentage of back to back meetings. Looking to increase cross departmental engagement to support innovation? Measure the connections taking place in Teams and Outlook through meetings, calls, chats and emails. Don’t like the pre-canned reports? No problems, build your own. Want to integrate absence data? No problems, build out reports with Power BI.</p>\n\n<p>Viva Insights gives your leaders and managers the support needed to understand their employees and what is influencing them. It also supports those insights with recommendations on what can be done to improve that as well with links to key reports and more articles in the inspiration library.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just insights though, there is also <a href=\"https://ally.io\">Ally.IO</a> (which will hopefully have a Viva name soon!) that helps to give data driven objectives for OKRs (Objective Key Results). These help people understand their purpose for the organisation as it aligns objectives from top to bottom but it also supports them with real data. It allows people to hook their Key Results as metrics with databases and tables providing the actual data to support the OKRs and the continuous feedback reviews.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>There is so much more to talk about with transforming the employee experience with Viva and I’m looking forward to being able to share that with you as part of the Viva Explorers. Between us, we cover so many different perspectives, from the technical to the cultural, the why you should to the what you should to the how you could. We will be sharing but also listening to your journeys and helping to feedback to Microsoft along the way.\nWhy do I do this? I want this focus on employees at the centre to benefit as organisations as possible and therefore help as many people as possible. Making change happen the right way is what makes transformations happen and stick which is where the true magic happen. Look out for more coming from the Viva Explorers soon...</p>\n\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/es/@martyman_55\">Martin Zdrazil</a> on Unsplash</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Beautiful city, great speakers, all the Microsoft content, plenty of drinks - that is the way to spend a couple of days. At the start of June, I was one of the over one thousand people who attended the Scottish Summit in Glasgow, a Microsoft Community event that has been running for several years now but was the first year back in person since the start of the pandemic. Here are a few of my thoughts as I head back home.</p>\n\n<h2>The importance of accessibility for all</h2>\n\n<p>It is always important as you come away from an event like the <a href=\"https://www.scottishsummit.com\">Scottish Summit</a> to reflect and work out what it will mean to you afterwards, what you have taken away from it. The biggest thing for me was easy - the importance of accessibility and making life easier for everyone, not just must people. The opening keynote was one of the most special I have ever seen as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmcginley\">Connell McGinley</a> spoke of his story as a deaf person in IT. The things that we take for granted like making a call or knowing when you are being asked a question suddenly become very different. One point that hit home is the ease at which we can accidentally exclude people - Connell was chosen as the person who sat in the data centre early in his career as the noise of the fan was thought to not affect him. It is these sort of exclusions and assumptions that we should all challenge in our selves.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Connell can now be so involved in IT is a huge win for the power of technology tools now as Microsoft Teams and captioning helps to make it more seamless for all to be involved. Small changes to our habits, enabled by the tech that we use can make a much bigger difference for others and is something we should all try. The applause for the session was lead by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donaSarkar\">Dona Sarkar</a> who asked us all to use the British Sign Language applause with our hands raised in the air and twisted, almost jazz hands style. The site of the crowd with their hands up was just beautiful and the number of people that continued to do that during the two days of the summit was inspiring.</p>\n\n<p>The accessibility theme continued through the rest of the conference with many sessions having sign language interpreters to make them available to all. There was plenty of tech sessions too, covering Power Platform, Microsoft 365, Dynamics and Azure. However, it was the non-tech sessions that I really took a lot away from, especially the panel sessions organised by Microsoft up on the 9th floor. The mental health session was incredibly open and the panellists shared some truly horrific stories of how they have been treated and the journeys they have been through. It was so helpful to not only remind me of things to do but to also learn more about the right and wrong things to do. I took away the most important things were to speak to people with mental health struggles, not to make assumptions about how they want to be treated and to try not to make statements that could be a trigger. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AzureRory\">Rory Neary</a> also gave a fantastic session on his own mental health challenges and his own reminders not to blame the trigger itself. Looking forward to continue the discussion on mental health as Rory joins <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com\">CPS</a> and sharing with others the tools and techniques that Dona Sarkar talked about in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uewTShNre7k\">her closing keynote</a> on how to discuss mental health at work.</p>\n\n<h2>Talks and talking</h2>\n\n<p>For the tech sessions, I will be honest that I missed many of the ones that I had intended to see. Why? Because I was chatting with people too much! Chatting about Viva, chatting about licensing (yes really) and an awful lot of chatting about life. People often talk about finding your tribe and that is what these events feel like. The chance to meet that virtual community that you have found in real life and find out that they are like that in real life too. It is hard to name all the people I enjoyed chatting with but I would like to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DamoBird365\">Damien Bird</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZaidZaim2k\">Zaid Zaim</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirrortears\">Kathrin Borchert</a> because I had either not met them or only briefly met them before and they were just the loveliest people. Real events open up the circle of people you meet and I truly hope that stays true with these three as well as the other awesome people I get to be with.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Presenting with the Viva Explorers on stage at the Scottish Summit\" src=\"/images/2022/06/ScottishSummitVivaExplorers.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>As well as nattering and building connections, I did also have the chance to be involved in three sessions. These were all sessions that I had run with others virtually in some way but this was the first time we&#39;d tried in person. What was great was how interactive they were and how we managed to get the audience interaction running nicely with them. I am a big believer in the virtual/hybrid world and the enablement that it brings and so it&#39;s less that we should all move to in-person and more that we should look more at those things and how we can do it more in the virtual space. Being there keeps you present so looking at your meetings and sessions, think about how you can disconnect from your other distractions. Think about how you can feed those cues to the people speaking without distracting too . Think about engaging with them at the right times as well. As a coordinator, think about giving people time while also making sure they connect to it. Realise that while there may be focus on one person, there are others to look at too. As a speaker, think about how you can move around and change the focus to keep the audience interested - swap from faces to presentations to other screens. It was great to be able to stand in front of others and I look forward to doing more but I also want to take that learning to use virtually too.</p>\n\n<p>Learning from how others speak as well was important. The different styles and seeing how the audience responded to those different styles. People rarely leave on their camera when watching virtual events but you can see the reactions and what engages people far more in person. My simplified views often take over in my head and think that all talks need to be exciting and energetic throughout but watching how others pace their sessions, bring in points to think about alongside sharing specific things, change up and down the sort of things that are being shown. All of these really help with how I can become a better speaker and a better consultant as well.</p>\n\n<p>As the recordings of some of these sessions become available, I will update this post with links.</p>\n\n<h2>The informal fun (as opposed to the formal fun)</h2>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t not mention the socialising. I feel like we may have helped fund Brewdog in Glasgow for the rest of the summer with the amount we were there but it was amazing to have big groups that you could just float about and chat to familiar faces. People are so friendly and welcoming at these events and open to new faces. I wrote previously about how hard it can be when you see familiar faces but the groups at these events are incredible so get chatting with them, make those connections and you never know where it will take you. The stories I heard over the last few days of new roles happening because of people knowing each other and building those relationships are a great way to justify the fun that you get to have to the poor family who are left behind as we travel to these events. I would like to say a big thank you to my wife and mother-in-law because I could not do things like this without their backing.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"One of the many visits to Brewdog - large group of people outside the Brewdog bar in Glasgow\" src=\"/images/2022/06/ScottishSummitSocialising.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>Back on the socialising, it seems a suitable point to end on a celebration. The highlight of many of these events has become the infamous pub quiz run by the legendary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewbibby\">Andrew Bibby</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tassyja\">Tricia Sinclair</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeeganMumInTech\">Keegan Stanton</a> and under the supreme leadership of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SharePoint_Zoe\">Zoe Wilson</a>, our team (Haggis and Chips) were champions! Not a bad way to round off a tiring but rewarding, inspiring and fun few days in Scotland.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Group shot of the Haggis and Chips team with the trophy for winning the charity pub quiz at Scottish Summit\" src=\"/images/2022/06/ScottishSummitQuizWinners.jpg\"/></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>On 16 June, Microsoft dropped a surprise on us - a brand new Viva pillar. Viva Sales has allows employees to enter CRM data, whatever your CRM and powered by AI. With nudges and hints to help you do the right thing, it will truly power a more productive and effective sales force (whether with Salesforce, Dynamics or something else). What is more interesting though is what this means to the future of Viva.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Viva?</h2>\n\n<p>Hopefully everyone reading this knows about <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva\">Microsoft Viva</a> but, just in case, it is the\nEmployee experience platform from Microsoft that puts the employee at the centre. It is formed of multiple pillars but all of this are centred around Teams as the platform so you can use all of them in your flow of work through Teams that must of us are already familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>The pillars are currently:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/connections\">Viva Connections</a> - connecting employees to the organisation, to each other and to the tools they need to get their job done</li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/insights\">Viva Insights</a> - providing personal productivity and leadership insights</li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/topics\">Viva Topics</a> - providing the right knowledge to the right people at the right time</li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/learning\">Viva Learning</a> - helping employees learn in their flow of work</li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/goals\">Viva Goals</a> - aligning culture and strategy throughout the organisation with OKRs</li></ul>\n\n<p>And now Viva Sales fits into these pillars too. There has been a seventh pillar announced as well with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/viva-and-glint\">Glint</a> due to be integrated into Viva to capture pulse surveys from employees, integrating the insights with what employees are saying.</p>\n\n<p>The common thread to these tools, as well as being employee focused, is that they bring AI power to them to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, Viva Topics will automatically extract knowledge topics from across your Microsoft 365 estate and Viva Learning will suggest courses from across your LMSs based on what courses you have taken and what people around you are looking at.</p>\n\n<p>The other common thread is that they connect into other platforms, this isn’t just a Microsoft thing.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Viva Connections has the dashboard which means you can easily bring live data to your digital workplace hub from any platform with an API</li><li>Viva Insights links in with Headspace and you can align your data through Power BI with any other data sources</li><li>Viva Topics will soon be able to index data from any other system with an API to inject your knowledge from services like Salesforce and ServiceNow</li><li>Viva Learning pulls from all your LMS platforms to give you one place for your learning content and with playlists across those</li><li>Viva Goals can power your key results from tools such as Jira, Asana, Google Sheets and more</li><li>Viva Sales will be able to update your CRM whether it is Dynamics, Salesforce or something else</li></ul>\n\n<p>This common thread neatly positions Viva at the centre of your Digital Workplace.</p>\n\n<h2>Tell me more about this Viva Sales</h2>\n\n<p>The focus of Viva Sales is around making it easier for those updating their CRM systems. Whether you are in sales or pre-sales, it can be a pain making sure that you capture updates into your CRM as you have those conversations with your clients and clients-to-be. Viva Sales aims to improve that by embedding into all the Office tools. This isn’t just a plug-in that brings things to one place though. It will use AI to make suggestions and nudges so that if you promised a client something, it will log that against that client and remind you. It will make sure that those leads are followed up. It will change the world!</p>\n\n<p>Ok, we must wait to see more details as the only information released so far is the video below but it gives you a great idea. Having this working regardless of your CRM will be very compelling as well.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNqVnBVCw6I&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCUVc08kmbA&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<h2>How does Viva Sales change things?</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the interesting and fundamental question that arises with the announcement of Viva Sales. This feels like a pivot in where Viva is going. Some on social media have spoken about Viva being an HR tool (I even heard the phrase and onboarding told) but it has always been more than that. The introduction of a sales oriented product suggests a move towards more role oriented products that suit particular employees more than others.</p>\n\n<p>Providing specific solutions to different areas of an organisation but with a common look and with the same AI powered goodness that also allows for more integration from other platforms that organisations are using feels like the new direction that Viva is expanding into. I have often spoken about Viva as a brand rather than a product and this expansion fulfils that further. The success of the recognition for the brand is taking off and Microsoft has recognised that and is building on that success.</p>\n\n<h2>Viva as the end user Microsoft Graph</h2>\n\n<p>This positioning of Viva as a brand feels like the positioning of it as the broader way of the different teams within Microsoft to provide a consistent message. Those close to Microsoft often talk of them “shipping the org chart” and having products competing because teams are competing for attention at Microsoft. A great example is where Microsoft 365 and Dynamics have in the past released similar sounding services and consuls rants and the MVP community are left fielding the “what should I use when” conversation. What this move to Viva Sales shows is not only are those teams working closer together than ever before, with the relationship here between Dynamics and Teams being particularly encouraging, but that there is that aim for that consistent approach externally. This will make life a lot easier for the average user.</p>\n\n<p>This approach follows what the Microsoft Graph has done already. It has become that consistent API across many diverse and fragmented APIs for each product. For the most part, when you learn how it works with one platform, it is consistent with all the others under it - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darrel_miller\">Darrel Miller</a> talks about this in a recent <a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-j2wx4-123d309\">Microsoft 365 Developer podcast episode</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By becoming the common user interface for these different services and building this into Microsoft Teams, the most commonly used service, Viva becomes the common end user tool across all the services to get things done. Users will know that they connect other platforms into it without learning new ways so much and will get the AI power to make it easy to do the right thing.</p>\n\n<h2>What will we see next?</h2>\n\n<p>We already know that the Glint integration will happen into Viva but what else? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lesley_wolan\">Lesley Crook</a> has a <a href=\"https://vivavisionary.uk/2022/06/16/hot-off-the-viva-press/\">great blog post</a> and suggests that ERP could be next. I hope that our Viva Explorer sessions on the battle between <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YbRNduoEaA0\">Dynamics HR and Viva</a> will lead to more integration for HR self service into Viva, especially around training.

            "content_html": "<p>With the general availability of Viva Goals at the start of August 2022, many people have been wondering what the benefits are. The honest answer is that the majority are to do with the OKR (Objective Key Result) framework that Viva Goals helps organisations to implement it but the tools are just part of the equation. This blog post looks into some of the challenges that OKRs along with Viva Goals look to address. Future posts will look into:</p>\n\n<ul><li>The what of Viva Goals - covering what OKRs are and how Viva Goals supports these across your organisation</li><li>The how of Viva Goals - how you can set up Viva Goals and how it can transform your organisation</li></ul>\n\n<h2>The super powers of OKRs</h2>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with some questions, some of which will be relevant to individuals, some to departments and some to the whole organisation.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Do you start work on a Monday morning and wonder why you are doing what you do?</li><li>Are you trying to help change the direction of your organisation?</li><li>Does your organisation have a clearly set strategy that the organisation understands?</li><li>Do you know how aligned people are to that strategy?</li><li>Are team or department siloes causing repeated work and miscommunication?</li><li>Do you find yourself doing the same thing day in, day out?</li><li>Are you being challenged in your role?</li></ul>\n\n<p>The super powers of OKRs can help you understand how all these can be addressed.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Focus</li><li>Alignment</li><li>Tracking</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Stretch</li></ul>\n\n<p>These take into account the areas that OKRs used across an organisation can help drive value but you may target different areas at different rates as well, especially for larger organisations. The more areas that you have onboard, the more alignment and focus you will have.</p>\n\n<h2>Focus and alignment</h2>\n\n<p>Do you remember last Monday morning? Perhaps you had a long weekend with the kids, fixing up the house the way you want it or were out making shapes at a festival. Monday morning may have felt painful and so turning on your PC/Mac may have kicked off that familiar feeling. What do I have to do today? Maybe you had a list or just went to your calendar to check what was going on. But did you know why? Were you just going through the motions with no real feeling as to how these tasks play into the wider picture of your department or whole organisation.</p>\n\n<p>OKRs provide a set of hierarchical objectives from the top to all employees. It allows you to align what you are doing with what you are meant to be doing and what the organisation is trying to achieve. It helps you look at new ideas you may have and to compare them to the key areas of focus to see if they link in with other&#39;s ideas.</p>\n\n<p>To drive a specific focus, organisation&#39;s should look to focus on just 3-5 goals per quarter so that employees are not pulled in many different directions at the same time. This helps to make sure that things get done rather than providing different pulls from different competing goals across different areas.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this in action myself. At a previous organisation, a new head of technology joined. In his first two months, he outlined his seven areas of focus along with a set of metrics that would be used to measure each one. Sadly, my memory of most of them has long faded but I remember that one was around the virtualisation of the server estate and another about getting a more service oriented approach to IT Teams (that were far more used to just getting an email and hoping they got round to it eventually in many cases). Each area was set a target to achieve and this was tracked on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>Many conversations were had about initiatives that were wanted to start but if they didn&#39;t align to one of the pillars then there was no traction. This brought the focus across all but also meant that people aligned what was needed to these pillars. For example, if we felt that the system we were developing could be more efficient, we could introduce the aim to reduce CPU cycles which would improve the virtualisation estate. It helped us align our own initiatives to those of the organisation and provide the focus for the value that should be achieved.</p>\n\n<h2>Tracking</h2>\n\n<p>While many organisation&#39;s may have their set of values and it may be well understood, these will often not stay as a centre of focus without understanding how things are going. The power of tracking means that not only is the focus and alignment to an organisation&#39;s strategy is understood but exactly what should be achieved at any point of time to achieve the strategy.</p>\n\n<p>OKRs provide this through the key result portion of the OKR, providing explicit values that can be tracked over time to determine if an objective has been met or not. This also allows tracking to see if the objective is on track to be met or not as well.</p>\n\n<p>The tracking at a deeper level in the organisation also allows managers and employees to have a more regular conversation around what they are achieving. This reduces the panic of ticking off all objectives at the end of the year and helps to steer a more realistic approach to objectives throughout the year. This keeps employees engaged with their objectives and prevents them becoming a side show to their main role while they become disengaged with ongoing improvement.</p>\n\n<h2>Transparency</h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever wondered what on earth another department actually does? Whether you are in operations and just think marketing fluff about sending silly social media posts or you are in marketing and wonder why sales never make anything of the leads you generate, siloes can cause big problems to a focused organisation.</p>\n\n<p>OKRs are designed to be as transparent as possible so that you understand everyone else&#39;s objectives as well as your own. This means you can find out what the focus of another team is and understand why they may not be reacting so quickly to your requests. It means that you can see if other teams are also looking at the same objectives as you to help build shared objectives.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most powerful things I heard at the last MVP Summit was two teams talking about having a shared OKR. It was nothing to do with Viva or Viva Goals but it demonstrated immediately to me that the common siloes that often appear at large organisation&#39;s like Microsoft were being broken down by these two teams. They were pulling in the same direction and people working with them would see that togetherness over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Stretch</h2>\n\n<p>There is a future post in the making that outlines the difference between KPIs and OKRs but one key aim of OKRs is to stretch everyone - individual employees, teams, departments and the organisation as a whole. If people are achieving their OKRs completely on a regular basis then they are not stretching themselves enough. The intention should be to push themselves and challenge themselves to be able to do more.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, this should be within reason and having no-one ever able to achieve anything. The stretch should be achievable but not unrealistic or people will drift away. It should make things interesting and drive more achievement.</p>\n\n<h2>Learning more about the why</h2>\n\n<p>If these examples have whet your appetite to hear more, do check out the book Measure What Matters by John Doerr. John was fundamental to getting OKRs to drive change at Google from the very early days. There are some great examples such as the change of measuring success for YouTube from number of videos to number of minutes watched, changing behaviour across the different teams and with the users themselves.</p>\n\n<p>OKRs, when implemented well, can provide such a powerful way of keeping people engaged with their achievements and their job as a whole. They can help individuals understand their Monday mornings and help organisation&#39;s drive change where needed.</p>\n\n<p>Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@rgaleriacom?utm<em>source=unsplash&amp;utm</em>medium=referral&amp;utm<em>content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Ricardo Gomez Angel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/transparent?utm</em>source=unsplash&amp;utm<em>medium=referral&amp;utm</em>content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>At Ignite last year, SharePoint Syntex became Microsoft Syntex and there were a whole load of new announcements including things like Archival, Backup, bulk translation and digital signatures, all coming to Syntex. One of the smaller updates announced has now come into public preview and that is a change to the cost model with Pay As You Go pricing.</p>\n\n<h2>What is meant by Pay As You Go pricing?</h2>\n\n<p>With the new Microsoft Syntex billing model, instead of paying per user as the current model requires, you are billed per use of Syntex. In terms of content processing, this means that each document that is analysed, you will have a charge for each document. This means that if you only occasionally use Syntex, your bills will go down significantly but this also allows you to try out Syntex at a low cost too.</p>\n\n<p>During the public preview, there is not cost at all for the document processing so this is an even better time to try Syntex out in your environments. At the time of writing, there is no confirmation on when the preview will end or what the cost will be at the end of the preview.</p>\n\n<h2>What can you do with Syntex?</h2>\n\n<p>The area I was interested in looking at was around the content processing. Syntex can process text related Office documents or images using two different engines. There is a <img alt=\"lot of material on Microsoft Learn\" src=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/contentunderstanding/syntex-overview\"/> around Syntex so I won&#39;t repeat that here. What I wanted to look at was one of the pre-built models that is designed for receipt processing.</p>\n\n<p>This model requires no initial set up and machine teaching - that work has already been done by Microsoft. Instead, you can switch it on and point it at your documents in a SharePoint library and have it extract the default content.</p>\n\n<h2>Why would you use this?</h2>\n\n<p>For larger organisations, they will usually already have an expenses system such as SAP Concur that has image processing to extract information from receipts. However, smaller organisations may find it useful to process receipts automatically to reduce the pain of submitting expenses, using mobile devices to scan them and Power Automate to trigger an approval process.</p>\n\n<p>There may be other, simpler scenarios where you want to process a set of receipts for other reasons such as capturing which vendors produce the most litter in an area. The bigger aim is to demonstrate how Syntex can be used to automate manual tasks.</p>\n\n<h2>Sharing how it works</h2>\n\n<p>I have recorded a video showing how it can be set up and the receipt model being put into place.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wxwvdZphgs&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<h2>Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Microsoft Syntex adoption should increase dramatically with the use of this new model as it greatly simplifies the costs and gives organisation more control. However, the real proof will be what the costs actually are as a high cost will put off larger scale use of Syntex for a large organisation. Time will tell whether this easier adoption leads to a longer usage pattern but I certainly hope that it does.</p>\n\n<p>Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@ml1989?utm<em>source=unsplash&amp;utm</em>medium=referral&amp;utm<em>content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Mike Walter&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/receipts?utm</em>source=unsplash&amp;utm<em>medium=referral&amp;utm</em>content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;</p>",
