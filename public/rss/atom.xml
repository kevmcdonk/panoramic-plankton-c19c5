        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having blogged at work previously, I thought making a decision on where to blog externally would be a nice simple one. My first thoughts were to use a platform to get up and running quickly. I had a <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogspot</a> login from many years back and follow a few people from LinkedIn and Medium but that didn&#39;t quite feel right. This will have elements of technical delivery on it so to have a site that can hold that as well as the blog content felt right. I already had my domain which was running my Office 365 domain but the public site on that was due to be decommissioned in March so it was time for a new site.</p>

<h2>How do you host your own blog?</h2>

<p>The first thing to decide on was a blog engine. I wanted something easy to host and deploy on a cloud platform. Coming from a C# background, my first thought was to use <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net">BlogEngine</a> and found that there was an <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/BlogEngineNET.BlogEngineNET">Azure marketplace entry</a> to get started quickly. With this, I was up and running in about 15 mins and could start creating my content. So did I stick with this?</p>

<p>No. Unfortunately while doing this, I was also watching <a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire">Halt and catch fire</a> with Joe MacMillan talking about challenging yourself to be better. I know C# but want to know more about NodeJS so took a look at what engines were available on that. The strongest one that I found was the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost publishing platform</a> and as well as having a <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org">large marketplace of themes</a>, it could host html content directly. A quick download from the <a href="https://ghost.org/developers/">developers site</a> and I was up and running (I already had Node JS and NPM installed).</p>

<h2>Changing the theme</h2>

<p>Browsing through the marketplace, I found a few different themes I liked the look of but what I really wanted was to look like an Office 365 blog. I had used the new blog pages from Delve and wanted to retain the look and feel. Having used <a href="https://dev.office.com/fabric">Office UI Fabric</a>, I took this as a basis and built up a similar look to the main Delve blogs. Being new to Ghost, I needed a little kick start to get moving and found that <a href="https://github.com/raivis-vitols/ghost-theme-willow">Raivis Vitols Willow Theme</a> was a close look to what I wanted and acted as a basis for it.</p>

<p>With some rework, I now had a theme which could be uploaded and you can see the SourceCode at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/GhostFabric.</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p>Next on to where it would be hosted. A blog about Office 365 had to be hosted on Azure, right? That was certainly my first reaction. I had four criteria:</p>

<ul><li>Easy to deploy</li><li>Could host NodeJS</li><li>Have a custom domain</li><li>Supports SSL</li></ul>

<p>Then the final thing was to be as cheap as possible.</p>

<p>Azure met all four criteria but to host a web app with SSL and a custom domain was looking at a higher price than I was hoping to pay. Next stop Amazon.</p>

<p>With their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">free tier for a year</a>, ability to have SSL and custom domains, this certainly felt like the right answer. I had used Azure to set up web apps quite a bit but this was my first proper exploration of AWS. The <a href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/">GhostForBeginners</a> page on <a href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/how-to-setup-an-amazon-ec2-instance-to-host-ghost-for-free/">setting up Ghost on AWS </a> got a site up on the AWS domain but finding out details around setting up the custom domain and SSL took a lot longer.</p>

<p>To help others get ahead, the first thing to say is that EC2 will only support SSL through a Load Balancer - here&#39;s <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/560552/how-to-forward-godaddy-domain-to-ec2-load-balancer">the post</a> that gave me the best confirmation of this. I followed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-certificate-manager-deploy-ssltls-based-apps-on-aws/">this guide</a> to set up the certificate and then <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/getting-started/">this post</a> to set up the load balancing. I hit a few bumps along the way with my domain provider, mostly due to trying to remember what a A record and CName is but it is also important that you set up with the certificate with *.yourdomain.com AND yourdomain.com (thanks to vercettie in <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=226133">this post</a> for pointing me right there).</p>

<p>The final step was to set up SMTP and I decided to keep it simple and used GMail. Bitnami&#39;s <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/ghost/#how-to-configure-outbound-email-settings">help page</a> got me details of the config but I also had to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console">install and connect with Putty</a> - make sure you check the bitnami docs to get the correct username.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s where it is now. There are a few changes I&#39;d still like to make:</p>

<ul><li>Add discussions, probably with Disqus</li><li>Improve on the profile pane on the homepage</li><li>Add some navigation for static pages</li><li>Support more profile links and make them dynamic</li></ul>

<p>I&#39;ll certainly give AWS a year and then review what the costs would have been after that.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>It is more than just an Intranet</h2>

<p>For people who have an Intranet at their organisation, there is a natural place to go to that people can say &quot;There&#39;s the Intranet&quot;. When it comes to a Digital Workplace, is there the same thing? How is it different?</p>

<p>The key is to have a hub that supplies three main functions for all staff, regardless of their location or area of the organisation:</p>

<ul><li>Stay updated</li><li>Stay productive</li><li>Stay connected</li></ul>

<p>Many current intranets are news driven and is often the key way that people across the organisation find out what is happening. Even in the modern workplaces, having an overall company vision is key and the central hub is vital to driving this still. Sharing what is happening in different areas and helping staff engage with these happenings ensures that you have an organisation moving along in the same direction, with the same goals and aims. But this is not everything.</p>

<h2>How you start your day?</h2>

<p>Think about how you start your day - what is the first thing you do? Check your email? Check a to-do list? Pick up the latest research? Confirm the latest sales figures? Where do you start with this? Most people now have to wade through their emails to get all of the above and this is where distraction kicks in. Instead of reading your latest research, you end up distracted by a different conversation. If you had a central hub showing all these items immediately, you can set up what is most important to you up front and quickly and easily get to your next set of items.</p>

<p>There is more than just functions at work though, there is also people - organisations are powered by the people that work there and the connections that exist are what enable work to happen. Social platforms help power these connections and set up teams and communities that would require huge effort to set in place without the natural evolution. Have an idea on how you could better support clients? Share it on a connection and join in with others who have similar ideas and can help.</p>

<h2>So what about Office 365?</h2>

<p>There are many platforms out there and ones that can be developed. The power that Office 365 brings to the table is a set of tools that most organisations are familiar with (Outlook, Word, PowerPoint) but now being brought together with the power of AI and Machine Learning to help get an understanding of what you are most likely to be working on and what people connected to you are doing. While updates/news have long been possible and enterprise social networks have become established with many organisations, the difference that Office 365 now brings is the ability to become more productive. One of the new examples of this has been where Cortana can now analyse your mails and if you have promised to reply to someone or create an action then it will automatically create that as a task. No more remembering at the end of each day to go through your notes and set up tasks for the next few days, Office 365 can start to do it for you. This is where productivity can start to be improved, allowing people to focus on important tasks without changing the way that they work.</p>

<h2>Help me to help you</h2>

<p>The key to all this is to have self-service, allowing people to do things themselves without waiting. Making things simple and easy to use with guidance available digitally. Many of the latest features of Office 365 have been about helping power users to be able to get things done without needing developer support. There is lots of help and support around Office and this can be supplemented with tools like WalkMe to provide the right guidance at the right time. Bots are now available to be created so that people can talk in natural language and get to the items they need. With PowerApps and Flow, users can create their own mobile first applications based on what they want.</p>

<p>My next couple of blog posts will tie together a few of these items mentioned and show how you could create a daily reminder to set your tasks for today and focussed on your key goals.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Do you remember the first day you started work?</h2>

<p>Perhaps it was in a fast food restaurant or shop. Perhaps it was, like me, in an office. Maybe there was a computer there, maybe not. For me, there was a large beige box. It had a large CRT monitor attached to it that didn&#39;t leave much space. There was a beige phone next to it with an extension number scribbled in pen on top. When I&#39;d found the right person who had an envelope with my password in, I logged in and found a blank blue desktop. I opened up Internet Explorer and there was a page showing some of the corporate news, some deal related news, a few links to key applications that &quot;everyone&quot; used and a big navigation bar along the top with a search box next to it. I browsed through some of the pages trying to suck in some information. Some had helpful details, some had conflicting details, some were obviously out of date. PING. I received an email from another colleague with some useful links and a lot of attachments that had to be printed, filled out and posted to various departments. I had to update my extension number on to the corporate phonebook. There was a huge shared drive with hundreds of documents to hunt through to find anything useful but I also needed to ask colleagues for documents they&#39;d stored on their C drive. After a few months of getting used to it, I started to feel a little productive.</p>

<p><img alt="Class assignment" src="/images/2017/03/Students_working_on_class_assignment_in_computer_lab.jpg"/></p>

<p>Fast forward to my last new starting day. Two flat screen monitors with a tiny box interfacing my virtual desktop. I logged on to the phone with my new ID that was there waiting in my email and it was already showing on my corporate profile. Opening up the browser showed corporate news, local news, news for my area and a set of links. Search was prominent and the page was dynamic. There was a new joiners section with all the details I needed to get going and nothing needed printing out. There was still a large navigation but most of the content was up to date and useful. There was still a shared drive but there was also a set of sites holding relevant information. Booking leave was online and if I had a question, there was a prompt asking if I needed help that then showed me what I needed to do. Even more, I could talk with others in the organisation, commenting on new ideas and seeing what people were thinking about - the pulse of the organisation was there ready for me. I had access through mobile apps and could log on to my virtual desktop from anywhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll confess, I have added some gloss to the latest story. Not everyone engaged online and not all information was straight forward to find. Commenting and sharing were active in some places but non-existent in others. At the time, news was very top down driven still and finding out what other teams were up to was hard. But all this was changing, people were collaborating more, sharing more information, getting engaged across different previously siloed areas. What was enabling this - the Digital Workplace.</p>

<h2>The Digital Workplace isn&#39;t just one single thing</h2>

<p>It&#39;s the use of digital platforms to get greater productivity for staff, aiding collaboration and knowledge sharing. The phrase first came to my attention as a member of the Intranet Benchmark Forum that became the Digital Workplace Group. Is it just a fancy name for an Intranet? No, as it encompasses how you engage with many other items, how you can work from anywhere, how you can chat with other people you&#39;ve never met but have similar passions to, how you can find out what is happening across an organisation, how you can form groups to get things done, how you can tell everyone else what you think is the Digital Workplace.</p>

<p>Does this sound like a load of waffle repeating what others have already said? Possibly. Plenty of people like Paul Miller, Gartner, Ephraim Freed, Christian Buckley and many others have spoken about it and often in a more eloquent way than I have here. What I will talk about is how digital workplaces can be established and the many challenges along the way - both technical and related to people. It&#39;s a bumpy road so what 4x4s are out there to help.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much has been discussed about why the results of the last US Presidential election and the UK referendum on leaving Europe were a surprising result but many of the analyses have agreed that a large part of both was a protest on the current state of affairs and a feeling that voices were not being heard. While I have my own feeling on both of the votes, the interesting thing for people working in the Digital Workplace realm is how similar things could happen in their own space. Both campaigns saw a large amount of polarisation of opinions with people tending to show a huge pull one way or another and not being willing to enter debate on middle grounds that much.</p>

<h2>Squeezing the middle</h2>

<p>The risk for Digital Workplaces is that the same polarisation occurs. It is easy to focus on the people that are technically savvy and happy to change their tools on a regular basis. They often have the latest phones and many apps on them, distracting them left, right and centre. They will have accounts on all the major social networks and probably have some in some of the smaller ones too. They will be happy to understand where they use each one, knowing that LinkedIn is best for work connections but you wouldn&#39;t link with your Mum while sharing your Facebook account with your boss may be a risk not worth taking. Taking this to work, they are comfortable that they could use Jira, Planner, Outlook or Excel for planning work and different tools work better in different situations. If you have a large development tracking enhancements to a product, Jira works beautifully. If you&#39;re keeping track of your daily tasks, pulling tasks out of your mail and in to an Outlook task is just fine (in fact, Cortana can even now pull these out automatically -http://mashable.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-cortana-email-reminders/#cyYF6smmUkqu)</p>

<p>At the same time, Digital Workplaces need to consider the people that are delivering meaningful work using email regularly, who are happy with their current set of PowerPoint templates and are meeting all their objectives. It is easy to sound dismissive of this but the highest paid traders and salesman who bring in the biggest accounts are usually not the people who collaborate most on a corporate network. They know and understand their network and what they need to do to get things done. They can still be helped by the Digital Workplace but to keep pushing new tools on to them will only make them more against the changes being encouraged.</p>

<h2>So how do you help make sure that everyone can benefit?</h2>

<p>Firstly, make sure you know what your overall strategy is. It&#39;s unlikely that getting as many people on Yammer as possible is actually the aim - you are more likely want to be able to help facilitate connections between areas of common interest. That may involve getting as many people as possible but is not the overall aim. The best way to set out this strategy is to agree on a one line vision statement. To many people, this feels cheesy and cliched but the discussion helps to ensure that all who are closely involved are comfortable that they are thinking the same way.</p>

<p>This leads on to defining your personas who are in the workplace. These should certainly fit your own organisation rather than from a boilerplate template but try to have no more than 4-5 and they could fit:</p>

<ul><li>Enthusiastic engager</li><li>Follower of the pack</li><li>Quiet observer</li><li>Not interested</li></ul>

<p>Do not spend too long discussing the nuances between these at this stage as the next step is to identify how you will place everyone in the organisation in to one of these personas. Obviously, sticking a post-it note to a wall for each person is not realistic for most larger organisations and you are unlikely to have a single group together that can know everyone. Instead, focus on metrics. Work out what you think people in each of the personas do and then identify metrics for that. One trick I have found useful with this is to think firstly of some natural fits that I know for each of the personas and then some people that blur the edges. Think about how the measures would identify these people and then either refine the analysis or the personas.</p>

<p>Once you have a way of identifying people to each persona, you can start on a plan of how you will engage with each group. This could be communications, training, meeting face to face or just leaving as they are. It could be changing the tone of some of your material to better suit different personas or even delivering different tools or enhancements to those tools. For example, people who have used SharePoint regularly get used to some of the quirks of one editting and webparts but if people only occasionally work with changing their content, it is not easy to know what to do. Products such as WalkMe offer a contextual help to people where they can ask simple or trickier questions and be guided through the right process. This will soon start to be supplanted by bots which understand who you are and what you have asked before, tailoring responses accordingly.</p>

<p>So there you have it all - your vision, your personas, your metrics and your actions to take. You can sit back, relax and maybe sip a cool gin &amp; tonic happy in a job well doneΓÇª.or you could go back to your measures and see if you are helping each persona enough. Are you seeing a shift to the more engaged and a drop in the number of not engaged? If not, why not? Time to get back out there and speak to people, get some feedback, review what people are doing instead of what you had hoped. Much like politics, it never really ends, just moves on to the next thing.</p>

<p>Some may find this depressing but this is where opportunity starts. The chance to take new ideas to help people be more connected and productive, to make life easier to do the simple things so they can focus on the important things.</p>

<p>Could the same be applied to the US elections and Brexit negotiations? Not to the same degree but the same logic applies. Try and understand what it is that people are finding hard and help with that. Easy, right?</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-03-15T14:27:11.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2017/03/14/microsoft-teams-rolls-out-to-office-365-customers-worldwide/">announcement on March 14th of the general availability of Microsoft Teams</a>, a new way of wrapping up Collaboration Tools became available for all enterprise Office 365 subscribers.</p>

<h4>So why is this vital?</h4>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-collaboration-tool-overload-1489370400">many</a>, <a href="http://moxtra.com/blog/why-organizations-should-avoid-too-many-collaboration-tools">many</a> <a href="https://en.share-gate.com/blog/microsoft-teams-office-365-collaboration-overload">different</a> <a href="https://www.tektonikamag.com/index.php/2017/01/26/why-everyone-hates-your-collaboration-tools-hint-theres-way-too-many/">articles</a> on why there are too many Collaboration Tools and the impact that this is having on employees. Give everyone too many tools and they have no idea where to start, they become clouded by confusion on where to go. However, as I noted in my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/trump-brexit-and-the-digital-workplace-yes-im-going-there/">last post</a>, you need to consider everyone in your plans. There will also be those who know what they want and want to have access to it....fast. They are happy with chatting to their teams on one social network, updating their tasks in tool, reviewing their CRM data in a third service. What owners of an organisation needs is a way to work for these different groups.</p>

<h4>Hubs and spokes</h4>

<p>So do you stop the spread of tools by having fewer? You could but you then restrict choice and ability for people to have the right tool for the right job. Ben Niaulin and Christian Buckley spoke at the European SharePoint Conference in Vienna last November about the need to make sure that you understand what the business wants and deliver the appropriate tools to meet that need (you can view the full speech <a href="https://www.sharepointeurope.com/presentations/espc16-keynote-2-form-meets-function-understanding-collaborations-cultural-fit/">here</a> but you will need to register - I would highly recommend registering as the ESPC team regularly produce some great content and will put on a <a href="https://www.sharepointeurope.com/">great conference in Dublin</a> this year). This means that you do not just have a single home where everything runs out of. You won&#39;t fit everything that people want in one place. Instead, you have a home area to share key organisational information and news which is then a hub to the rest of the other connected hubs.</p>

<p>Each hub is a relevant collection of information for a specific purpose that connects to the other hubs.</p>

<ul><li>Working on a project? Connect to your project hub to see the latest status updates, project artefacts and tasks for all team members.</li><li>Interested in client experience? Connect to the client experience community hub to share ideas and work on initiatives together.</li><li>Team meeting coming up? Connect to your team hub to discuss the agenda and make the most of the time.</li></ul>

<p>How does this make things simpler for people? While the diagram below talks about Teams and CRM and others, the reality is that these hubs will be relevant to what people are doing. The focus shifts away from tools to what people are themselves doing. I don&#39;t care that much about Slack but I do care about what the Ghost development community are up to - that&#39;s why I signed up.</p>

<p><img alt="The digital hubs and spokes" src="https://mcdonnell-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kevin_mcd79_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=055119dce270d4c978d2f62fb5cb1eba8&amp;authkey=AeA3sMq90sAgORaFrhrlOS8"/></p>

<h4>So how does Microsoft Teams fit in to this picture?</h4>

<p>OK, firstly, whether we&#39;re talking about Teams, Slack, Hipchat or something else, the key is how it connects together different services for a specific purpose. What Teams does well is to bring together in one place all the relevant info for a team. If you are a dedicated Microsoft junkie then you probably already have files in OneDrive and SharePoint and possibly some tasks in Planner. What Teams has done well is to allow you to extend that to other services like Trello and SAP using bots (conversations with a service), tabs (views of other content in your applications) and connectors (embed notifications within your team feed). This isn&#39;t limited to third party applications, you can connect up to your own in-house hosted of developed services as well.</p>

<h4>But isn&#39;t Microsoft Teams all about chat?</h4>

<p>Chat is a mechanism to connect with people and Teams definitely empowers that. It helps to silo your conversations and get to the right people at the right time, whether through text chat (and those animated gifs that are much loved/loathed) as well as realtime voice and video utilising Skype for Business. But it doesn&#39;t stop there as it allows you to work together as well with the files you need and the tasks together in one place.</p>

<p>The best example I saw on this was at last year&#39;s Future Decoded event in London where a team presented on the power of O365 Groups - Teams was announced later that day and I believe much of what they showed was using Teams but they couldn&#39;t announce that yet. The group of four people had not met face-to-face before the conference and pulled together a 45 minute presentation using the Teams tools with the single presentation shared and updated directly, meetings organised through the team and ongoing conversations throughout. Many small teams spring up like this and the tools are geared to support this focussed collaborative effort.</p>

<h4>Let&#39;s be honest though...this is the final nail in the coffin for Yammer?</h4>

<p>When Teams was first announced, Microsoft were very clear that there was still a path for Yammer. The picture above shows Teams working together and they have a common task, a reason to focus on. Whether that is a project team with a specific deadline, a product team that works together to continuously improve on a product or a hierarchical team that sits in an organisation, there is an aim for the team.</p>

<blockquote><p>Team - A group of people with a full set of complementary skills required to complete a task, job, or project.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/team.html</em></p>

<p>A community is a group of people with a common interest. The big difference in most organisations is that a community may not know each other before they start and will evolve as people become interested. This was a lot harder to organise and discover in the pre-digital workplace times but with social networks, the ability to search for groups of people with the same interest has become easier. My first day of a job, I asked on our social network if anyone was interested in mud runs and quickly found out that there was a group that had done Tough Mudder and ran a weekly boot camp. I joined the first week and gained a new network of people outside of my main work.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with Yammer? Well it fits best with this latter group, where there is not a specific goal but a set of people interested in the same thing. They may evolve a goal or goals that require a more focused team but more often they are a loose knit collection. Yammer is currently Microsoft&#39;s answer to supporting these needs and it has affirmed this with the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2017/03/02/yammer-integration-with-office-365-groups-now-rolling-out/">recent update</a> that creates an Office 365 group for each Yammer group. This allows organisations to neatly segregate their open public communities in to Yammer and keep the focused goal-driven teams in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>However, the line has been blurred now with Teams now announcing public teams as part of the March 14th general availability. Should you keep Yammer and Teams and have them separate? Well, that is entirely up to you! If you think your organisation is comfortable working across different platforms for different usages, go for it. If you think it will seed confusion, stick to one (and I&#39;d certainly recommend Teams if you pick one at this stage). The choice is yours.</p>

<h4>Has that quietened the cacophony?</h4>

<p>Sounds simple, right? Use Microsoft Teams and all your dreams will come true. Obviously it&#39;s not as easy as that. What is needed is to develop a structure that meets the needs. There isn&#39;t a magic bullet. However, Teams provides a compelling service to pull together different needs. More importantly, it highlights a model of wrapping together multiple services in to one single connected package to help guide people to the right place to do things. Let&#39;s hope that this is the start of something beautiful.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>&quot;I do not like them in a box. I do not like them with a fox.&quot;</h2>

<p><img alt="Green eggs and ham" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/4/47/6a00e54ef837538833015433a23709970c-500wi.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/163?cb=20130813204632"/></p>

<p>The trusty kitchen calendar. For many years, we have had a kitchen calendar pinned to the wall, just next to the sink. Each month is neatly divided up so we have a section for each of us - Daddy, Mummy and the two kids. It has even become a tradition for my parents to buy us a new one for Christmas with clear requirements for enough space for us all and preferably a little notepad underneath for the missing sections. If there are any arguments, the calendar is always the word of truth. No appointment is truly booked until it has been etched in stone aka scribbled in biro.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<h2>&quot;I will not eat them in a house. I do not like them with a mouse.&quot;</h2>

<p><img alt="Not in a house or with a mouse" src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/8/83/I_do_not_like_them_with_a_mouse.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20161203013844"/></p>

<p>Finally, after years of trying to persuade my wife that we need an electronic version so that we can actually see what we have booked while we&#39;re out of the house, I have a break through! As it was my birthday yesterday, she bought me a shiny iPad mini and a holder for it to attach it to the wall. Just slightly further away from the sink than the paper version, we now have an electronic device on the wall.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours setting up new calendars in my O365 account, one for each of us and there was even space for our impending arrival in April. These were then synced up on my phone and my wife&#39;s before syncing all on to the iPad. There are plenty of options for calendar apps but for now I kept with Outlook on iOS that we have both been using.</p>

<h2>&quot;I do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere!&quot;</h2>

<p><img alt="I do not like them here or there" src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/4/41/I_would_not_like_them_here_or_there..png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20161203012625"/></p>

<p>Next step was to add even more potential efficiency as I set up a Trello account for us all and started putting the list of tasks for all of us. I used the Card Repeater Power-Up (http://blog.trello.com/trello-card-repeater) so that we could have regular tasks, especially for our eldest who has his pocket money linked to getting his tasks done. After a few hours, I then had my long list of tasks up for setting up the baby&#39;s room and getting the garden ready for summer. My wife is now busily re-sorting them in to priority order - I did suggest a daily stand-up meeting but this was probably a step too farΓÇª</p>

<h2>&quot;I do not like Green eggs and ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am.&quot;</h2>

<p><img alt="I do not like green eggs and ham" src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/0/06/And_not_with_a_mouse.png/revision/latest?cb=20161203131043"/></p>

<p>Going back to the title of the post, this is much like the character from Dr Seuss&#39; classic. He refuses to try Green Eggs and Ham because he doesn&#39;t like the look of it. He doesn&#39;t want to do anything different at all. It doesn&#39;t matter where it is, who it is with, how it is with. Whether it is a Mac, a PC, an iPad or a Kindle. It&#39;s a change for something that is key to the way our lives work and the thought of that working caused panic. The more I suggested it, the bigger a thing it became. The bigger the swell against it.</p>

<p>Until finally, the boat collapsed, we were in the ocean and my wife gave in. Let&#39;s try it.</p>

<p><img alt="I like them" src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/5/5b/I_like_green_eggs_and_ham.png/revision/latest?cb=20161203142750"/></p>

<p>So far, she loves it. She has filled her and my weekends and we both know what is happening. She knows when I&#39;m planning to be out and when I can pick up the kids. I know if she&#39;s likely to be back late as she&#39;s seeing a friend. We have all the kids booked in for their playdates and in some cases have even shared the invite with the parents.</p>

<p>What has been even better is adding some more things on the iPad. It now has the Sonos Controller on there and it&#39;s so much easier to set the radio on than unlocking the phone. I&#39;ve also set up Find iPhone so we can both track down where we left the phone. Another plus is setting up Netflix so I have something to keep me entertained while washing up. I&#39;ve even debated suggesting the new Office 365 Bookings app so friends can book slots but think I may be taking that too far!</p>

<p>What does this mean to everyone else?</p>

<p><img alt="Everyone else" src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/2/2e/I_do_so_like_green_eggs_and_ham.png/revision/latest?cb=20161203145348"/></p>

<p>Am I saying that everyone should have a tablet attached to the wall? No, not necessarily. It works great for us but may not for you. What I&#39;m saying is that you shouldn&#39;t just stick with the old way of doing things. Try out new ideas and see if it can make you more efficient. New tips can make life much easier and streamline your day to focus on more interesting things. Try and ditch your paper notepad for a tablet for a while - searching for old notes is so much better.</p>

<p>There are a very large number of processes in most organisations that have gradually slipped in to tradition but are not as efficient as they could be and don&#39;t make the most of modern changes. Traditional hierarchy intranets should not be the sum total of the intranet and email should not be your only collaborative tool. Slack and Microsoft Teams offer new alternatives that require people to change the way they do things but the results can be achieved surprisingly easily.</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes and if you have any suggestions for other calendar apps, please do <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk">tweet me!</a></p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-03-20T23:43:39.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Teams has brought a new way for Office 365 users to collaborate together and stay productive as a team. As I said in my last post, it also brings together multiple areas to connect different services together. One of the more interesting aspects is the integration with the Bot Framework and how this can be used to bring forward what Microsoft has been calling &quot;Conversation as a Service&quot;. The change this brings about is the ease of use of different services through natural interaction in a single place. People can chat to a bot in their Teams channel to either update a client in Salesforce or query a set of knowledgebases to answer a question.</p>

<p>First though, I needed something for the bot to write to and so I picked up on a good idea suggested to me last year - Project Pulse.</p>

<h4>The Project Pulse app</h4>

<p>When a project is running, it is useful to know how the team and key stakeholders are feeling on a regular basis. This is often done with status reports but it would be great if you could quickly capture the &quot;pulse&quot; of a project. Hence, Project Pulse.</p>

<p>The app is created using the SharePoint Framework and uses Node JS. You can view the full source code at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79ProjectPulse. It shows a set of emojis that are easy to click on and submit your feeling for the day.</p>

<p><img alt="Capture the pulse" src="/images/2017/12/Project-Pulse-view-1.PNG"/></p>

<p>Once submitted, it will show the average temperature for the day from everyone who has submitted.</p>

<p><img alt="Show the temperature" src="/images/2017/12/Project-Pulse-view-2.PNG"/></p>

<p>The app was built up using much of the great documentation available around the framework starting from https://dev.office.com/sharepoint. The differing parts were how to create the SharePoint list including Content Types and Site Fields - how to do this came from https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/toolchain/provision-sharepoint-assets but I also found that using the standard Visual Studio 2015 SharePoint template allowed an easier creation of the schema needed.</p>

<p>Once I had a working solution, testing it in my local workbench and then deployed to my tenant&#39;s workbench, I took a look at how to host the files correctly. I debated these being deployed in to SharePoint as part of the solution but the more sustainable way that reduced duplication was to use the Office 365 CDN that is in preview. I found that Waldek Mastykarz&#39;s great blog had a post that covered how to set this up. I created a new site collection called CDN and placed a folder in Site Assets for my files. During testing, I used the direct link to this folder rather than the CDN link as it took time for files in the CDN to update.</p>

<p>There are more improvements to be added such as better checking for whether the person has already submitted a pulse, more views to show the longer term temperature and the ability to customise further the different emotions (not everyone is a fan of Meh...)</p>

<h4>Adding a bot</h4>

<p>The next step was to work out how a bot could be used for this. I kept this very simple and decided that the bot could be used to submit the pulses. With Microsoft Teams now, you can add a new bot to a channel and @ mention it to interact.</p>

<p>The code for this is all available at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79ProjectPulseBot.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot on a Team channel" src="/images/2017/12/Teams-bot.PNG"/></p>

<p>Many of the steps to follow are outlined in the main Bot Framework documentation. I decided to create a Node JS bot and so followed https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/overview/#navtitle. I downloaded the Bot emulator and within half an hour, had a Bot that replied to a specific message. I next followed the links in the documentation to deploy to Azure and had a working Bot published. The next step was to sideload this Bot into one of my Teams channels and I had a Bot I could interact with from the Teams app. Easy so far!</p>

<p>I wanted to make the interaction process as natural as possible so I introduced LUIS. For those who don&#39;t know, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/luis-api/documentation/home">LUIS</a> is not a friendly developer who could help me out but part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services">Cognitive Services stack</a> from Microsoft that allows your Bot to better understand natural language. It works by working out what your intent is for your conversation and pulls out the different entities from the text. For example, my main intent was to add a pulse and the entity defined was the type of Pulse, i.e. Happy, Meh or Sad.</p>

<p>The hardest part with the LUIS integration was identifying how to do this from the samples. Many of them worked using the IntentDialogs but I found that a Dialog with a TriggerAction at the end worked best for me. The standard samples at https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node/examples often referenced only the inbuilt entities rather than custom created ones.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to be able to write back to SharePoint so needed to have Office 365 authentication. For this, I was helped by a <a href="http://thecollaborationcorner.com/2017/01/25/search-for-your-sharepoint-content-from-a-bot-using-the-bot-framework-oauth2-and-node-js/#.WMl7lTvyjic">great blog</a> by Frank Cornu which talked through much of this process. It suggests using adal-npm and setting up an Azure AD application. As you can see from the image above, the first time you speak to the Bot, it asks you to login and then allows you to submit a pulse.</p>

<p>I have since found that with the Bot in Teams, it does currently ask for you to login for each conversation. If you reply to a comment, it retains the token but loses it within a new conversation. This leads me on to some of the other areas where I&#39;d like to build on. It would be good to be able to ask what the temperature of any specific day is within the Bot and also to reduce the need for the authentication to speed up submitting the thoughts. This could then expand in to being an overall project tracking Bot to capture items for the daily stand-up as well as the daily pulse.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>It was very simple to pull together a simple Bot that is usable and useful. There will be many other scenarios that could be used for simple ideas like this and I hope that the code acts as a useful guide for others.</p>

<p>I am interested to see how well this scales for larger Bots dealing with more scenarios but think that the majority of situations will be better handled by more single-minded Bots with a directory to help answer your questions on which Bot to use when. There will certainly be a lot of continuous improvements needed for any developed Bots and people should prepare for this. Reviewing the analytics of what people are asking will be key and LUIS is well set-up to capture these details. If people often ask for the same thing, you can set up new intents and entities to cater for it, e.g. if lots of people submit an angry pulse then a new pulse should get added.</p>

<p>I would love to hear from you on your experience with creating Teams Bots and any ideas for taking the Project Pulse Bot forward.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-04-07T07:56:18.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around this time last year, there were still a few voices talking about the death of SharePoint and its disappearance as a brand, prompting Microsoft to hold a &quot;Future of SharePoint&quot; event. As someone who has worked with it in various forms since 2004, I was not worried that it would vanish but knew that the branding of things was changing. The name of SharePoint has long been a dirty word for enterprises fed up with difficult to use sites, confusing ways of adding images, badly implemented farms and customisations that argued with each other constantly. However, for me, the Future of SharePoint event changed a lot of that and showed that Microsoft wanted to take a new way forward that was simpler, better looking, mobile focussed and extendable but still keeping that name of SharePoint. The bad name that it had in some places was offset by the large number of people who knew it as the go-to place to find information.</p>

<h3>The SharePoint Virtual Summit</h3>

<p>Roll on just over 12 months and Microsoft will run <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2017/03/21/announcing-the-sharepoint-virtual-summit/">another online event</a> and so we are likely to see more announced for the upcoming year that continues to improve on what has been delivered already- from modern lists and libraries to mobile apps, 25TB site collections to the SharePoint Framework, Team site news to a new landing page for all sites. A lot was promised at last year&#39;s event which was delivered and I expect this year&#39;s to be exactly the same. But what will it actually include? Here are my thoughts.</p>

<h3>Publishing Pages</h3>

<p>The big excitement that came first with the new blog experience and then with the Modern Pages was always offset a little by the lack of publishing and the lack of columns. I loved these new blocks that were more naturally responsive and looked great but knew that many people don&#39;t want to have to keep scrolling, especially on desktops where SharePoint is used more.</p>

<p>The good news is that there is plenty of talk about these changes coming which I take to mean that the engineering team want to make sure they get it right. Wes Hackett (CTO of the fantastic <a href="http://www.addin365.com/">Add-In365</a> and Mark Kashman both spoke with Jeremy Thake (<a href="https://www.hyperfish.com">Hyperfish</a> - highly recommend the product and the <a href="https://blog.hyperfish.com/tagged/podcast">podcast</a>) about these pages and the importance that they will bring. There is still a push from page owners to get plenty of info up front and the modern pages just don&#39;t quite cut it for that.</p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://blog.hyperfish.com/getting-the-most-out-of-office-365-with-wes-hackett-hyperfish-podcast-249618d4656f?source=collection_home---4------1-----------">Getting the most out of Office 365 with Wes Hackett</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<ul><li><a href="https://blog.hyperfish.com/the-future-of-sharepoints-intelligent-intranet-with-microsoft-s-mark-kashman-hyperfish-podcast-63ff208c0a07?source=---------3">The future of sharepoint&#39;s intelligent Intranet with Mark Kashman</a></li></ul>

<p>The other side connected to this is to take Team news and extend to the wider org. There are great products out there that allow for this but to have this built in and readily available will improve the ability for people to get used to sharing info. From previous experience, people want a combination of sites that have info for their team or community and another that is for the wider population. Sharing is definitely encouraged but there are still many times when news needs to just be shared to those that are allowed to see it against those that want to. There is also the aim to surface interesting content to wider audiences.</p>

<p>I think that Microsoft will start to make this a little easier but still leave a space for ISVs to provide an enhanced experience where people want that bit more.</p>

<h3>Full page customisations and a JSLink replacement</h3>

<p>Despite a large change in the stack of technology used for SharePoint development that developers need to learn, the SharePoint Framework has generally been well received. The ability to use modern techniques and have a model that allows development without a full SharePoint implementation on their local machine has made life a lot easier for devs - for example, I am more than happy to build webparts on my Surface Pro 3 and still do work while on a plane or train with no wi-fi. There are some impressive webparts out there and <a href="https://dev.office.com/code-samples#?filters=sharepoint%20framework%20app">great examples from PnP</a> on how best to do this in multiple frameworks like React and Vue.</p>

<p>What is missing though is the larger page experience. There is still the need for the wider add-in model but this now feels lacking compared with SPFX. Deploying connected lists and libraries is still painful despite the good work and I expect to see a solution for replacing more solutions with the modern stack.</p>

<p>I also expect this to extend to the ability to integrate customisations with modern lists as well, replacing the older JSLink model that is not yet available. The citizen developer (<a href="https://blog.hyperfish.com/the-future-of-citizen-development-in-sharepoint-with-the-sharepoint-framework-3116a9dc3e9b">discussed by Jeremy Thake recently</a>) still like to be able to make small tweaks to single lists and JSLink was a way to do this, however painful it could get. I expect to see a much better solution coming that allows people to add things like dashboard icons to a list.</p>

<p>Microsoft have also discussed making it easier to integrate solutions with the Microsoft Graph and I hope to see more of that announced around the event.</p>

<h3>Better story for ISVs to deliver solutions</h3>

<p>Alongside the enhanced customisation solutions above, I believe that there will be more opportunity to monetise customisations for ISPs. At the moment, there has been no store for new webparts and so ISVs have had to find different ways to work on these. I expect this to change and make it easier to grab impressive changes.</p>

<p>Having said that, I hope that it does not kill off the great community work that has taken place with open sourced collections like the <a href="https://github.com/OlivierCC/spfx-40-fantastics">SPFX 40 fantastics available</a>.</p>

<h3>More integration for Flow and PowerApps</h3>

<p>I have a love hate relationship with Flow and PowerApps - I absolutely love what they do but often hit weird problems with doing anything beyond the demo level work. The great news is that they are changing all the time and issues like not being able to process JSON that I found from the <a href="https://www.sharepointeurope.com/events/espc16-hackathon-results/">European SharePoint Community Hackathon</a> were resolved by the time Martin Veen and myself ran a <a href="https://www.sharepointeurope.com/trump-creating-engaging-powerapp-machine-learning-matter-hours">webinar</a> on this a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>The big chance that will make a difference is to embed these PowerApps in to the browser itself and truly fill what InfoPath can do. Microsoft has been clear that these are not direct replacements for InfoPath and workflows but they can meet all of the needs and more, including a better enhancement process.</p>

<h3>More Bot integration</h3>

<p>The release of Microsoft Teams has shown that Microsoft fully intends to be at the forefront of the bot revolution and not just by having the platform in the Bot Framework but built in to their products. There will be more coming with this and SharePoint is a natural place to include bots where you can interact on the home of your shiny new Intranet. The first phase of bots have been more fun and consumer related but Teams has started the flow towards more enterprise focussed bots and SharePoint will likely continue this.</p>

<p>What bots can you expect to see? The Who-Bot (https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-teams-introduces-t-bot-and-who-bot) will be an obvious starter and there will likely be some bots to help people find the right information, building on top of the Microsoft Graph to get people to the right place faster. These will neatly give wider access to the digital workplace through integration with other platforms like Skype for Business and even SMS.</p>

<p>What I would love to see!</p>

<p>These ones I&#39;m not so sure on but would certainly love to see turn up.</p>

<ul><li><em>Better way to move between different tenants</em> - for those that work on multiple instances, it is very painful to move between different tenants with some services remembering your details and not making it obvious who you are logged in as. Not sure what the solution is but there is definitely the chance for a better experience.</li><li><em>Even more integration with the Cognitive Services</em> - the access to intelligence as a service has opened up more possibilities and ISVs will fill the gap with add-ins if Microsoft doesn&#39;t. The ability to add summaries automatically to each of your pages and gauge the sentiment for an organisation from analysis opens up new ways of working and it would be nice to see Microsoft get in there early with these. However, they need to make sure that these can be turned off for enterprises concerned about where this information will go.</li><li><em>People to stop asking about whether to use Yammer or Teams or Groups</em> - this is a real long shot and I saw another email newsletter today talking about this. I hope that people will start using the different services and decide what best meets the need of the organisation rather than focussing on what each of them can do so much.</li></ul>

<h3>What do you think?</h3>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear what else you think might be coming and will definitely revisit this after the May event. To keep you entertained during the event itself, keep an ear out for these #buzzwordbingo phrases. There&#39;s a huge prize if you can find all of them - my undying admiration of your listening skills.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Some thoughts on platform change and how we should think about it</h4>

<p>There was a great piece of news today with <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Yammer-Blog/Edit-Post-is-Here/ba-p/61461">the announcement that Yammer now allows editing of existing posts</a>. You will be able to see that posts have been edited and the history of changes are shown. What is great about this announcement is that it was announced through a small post on the community site and echoed on the Yammer Twitter account - not through massive announcements.</p>

<h4>But, if it was that small a thing, why has it taken so long?</h4>

<p>While involved in a recent plan to roll-out Yammer, there was a lot of discussion about the ability to edit posts. Small typos still wind up a lot of people and there are times that your first post just doesn&#39;t quite meet what you are really trying to say. This was certainly a big topic so you would think that the Yammer team would get everyone on it and make it happen. That&#39;s all it needs right?</p>

<p>This is where some experience with development helps to understand why things take longer than others. Platforms like Yammer are geared up to huge volumes of data that changes on a regular basis. Setting data up to be written and then read allows it to be performant and quick to consume, with filtering and sorting all in place. If you allow that content to be edited, the performance of accessing that content plummets as well.</p>

<p>So now something that feels like a simple change suddenly has a potential impact to the entire performance. Of a cloud platform. Used by tens of thousands of people. And they depend on it.

<p>Instead, there will have been hours of unit and automated testing followed up by beta testing and pilots. This is where the Dev Ops practices that have been talked about really kick in. The modern ways of working that the cloud espouse allow for changes to be made and tested effectively but that isn&#39;t all that is required. No amount of automated testing can stop a hard to use user experience so there also has to be real world usage of it as well.</p>

<h4>Why does it matter to me?</h4>

<p>There are different streams to how these thoughts could impact you.</p>

<p><img alt="User" src="/images/2017/04/Photo-Android-Smartphone-Phone-User-Instagram-634069-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>You&#39;re a passionate user of these platforms</strong> - you want to see change happen fast but you need it to be reliable. You won&#39;t know whether a nosql database that doesn&#39;t need re-indexing into bla bla bla or not. You just want to be able to share content with your connections and build relationships. And it should work all the time.</p>

<p>What you should do though is keep talking with the product teams and their connections. Tell people what it is that you want to see and help them realise the importance of things like editing. Sign up for the <a href="https://yammer.uservoice.com/">User Voice</a> and fill out those surveys that are sent round. When there is some A/B testing, feedback that you like or don&#39;t like it with some constructive thoughts. Finally, be nice! There are rare times that people do things just to wind people up.</p>

<p><img alt="IT Pro" src="/images/2017/04/laptop-1.jpeg"/></p>

<p><strong>You&#39;re an IT Pro managing one of these platforms</strong> - aka the one stuck in the middle. You have to deal with the changes taking place and take the flack when people don&#39;t like it. People don&#39;t listen to what you think whether it&#39;s on your changes or why it takes so long and you always get blamed. So what should you do about it?</p>

<p>Make sure that you have all the latest information at your fingertips and point people towards those references. Not everyone likes what they hear but make sure that they know what is planned and this eases any pain. In the other direction, make sure that you help to pass on feedback as to what has and hasn&#39;t worked and what is really being demanded.</p>

<p><img alt="Developer" src="/images/2017/04/7643288084_09053952da_b-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>You&#39;re a developer</strong> - you spent hours on a great bit of code that improves the performance, is fully unit tested, has automated UI tests to ensure it stays working and was delivered ahead of plan. It&#39;s delivered and nothing is heard. The next change is a font colour change and Twitter is raving about the improvements. It&#39;s a hard life.</p>

<p>What can you do? Keep on doing things as you are. Changes will continue working well with the right level of testing and people will never be happy. One of my favourite stories from Worse Than Failure is the <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/The-Speedup-Loop">speed-up loop</a>. Sometimes, the hard but important work is also the most invisible to give the value. I still believe in the transparency of agile but it does need to be tied up with a pretty bow occasionally!</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em> - Yammer kindly <a href="https://twitter.com/Yammer/status/852643424130007040">tweeted me</a> with a great post about what it took to apply editing to posts. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Yammer/Why-is-Editing-Messages-So-Complex/td-p/28340">Interesting read</a> on the details.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2017-04-19T15:10:20.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on from one of my earlier and most popular blog entries about <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/stay-productive-creating-a-three-daily-tasks-app-in-powerapps-and-flow/">creating a daily tasks app in PowerApps</a>, Microsoft today <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2017/04/19/introducing-microsoft-to-do-now-available-in-preview/">announced a new To-Do app</a>.</p>

<h4>Why should you use this and not Trello/Wunderlist/etc?</h4>

<p>The app has been built by the team behind Wunderlust and is designed to neatly segregate your tasks in to groups. This means you can quickly see what you have to do.</p>

<p>The difference that you don&#39;t see in many other apps is that it builds on Microsoft&#39;s intelligence as a service platform to suggest tasks for that day. It will look at repeating tasks that you have done before and suggest them. Forgotten to add your weekly report? It will notice that you&#39;ve done this a lot before and suggest it.</p>

<p>Finally, it is built in to Office 365 so if you are already using that, you will have the same security features as you see in other apps. You don&#39;t need to have Office 365 to use it (I&#39;ve tried with my live.com account as well) but if you do, then you can have all your key tasks secured safely across multiple devices.</p>

<h4>Can I use it now?</h4>

<p>The apps are available on iOS, Android, Windows and the web right now - check the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2017/04/19/introducing-microsoft-to-do-now-available-in-preview/">blog link</a> for links. I have checked my own Office 365 tenant and don&#39;t yet have the ability to enable it there but will update this post as soon as I see it there.</p>

<p>I have tried many of the different task apps and the lack of focus for a daily set of tasks has always put me off using them consistently. From what I have tried so far (about 30 mins worth), this fits much closer to what I tried to achieve in my basic PowerApps version.</p>

<h4>What next?</h4>

<p>Unfortunately for all the Wunderlist users out there, it does appear that they are looking to gradually shutdown Wunderlist. They have promised to provide all the functionality in To-Do and I would hope that this includes a migration of tasks as well.</p>

<p>They have also promised more to come with additional integrations appearing. Look forward to seeing how this will integrate in to teams and can see more bots to help you add and manage tasks as well.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2017-05-07T20:07:37.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession to make. I don&#39;t hate meetings. Most conversations and reading that I have done suggests that I&#39;m in the minority here. Wasted time, lack of follow up and running round in circles are the common problems I hear. So why don&#39;t I find these time wasters so bad?</p>

<p>There are plenty of detailed posts out there on how to ensure that you set an agenda for a meeting correctly, pushing a focused meeting that doesn&#39;t deviate and ending a meeting when that aim is met, not using up time for the sake of it. For me, it&#39;s the time needed afterwards to get the most out of it that gets me. Discussion on the right topics and making sure that everyone is thinking a similar way is so important but if you end the meeting and that is the end of it, then it is time wasted. Those good ideas discussed are just ideas and without any follow up, then they are gone.</p>

<h4>Taking notes that you can do something with</h4>

<p>This blog appears to becoming a confession blog. I confess that I am a OneNote addict. For about four years now, I have used OneNote mostly on my Surface tablet and phone. Why? Mostly because I like the freedom of scribbled notes that act as enough of a reminder for me to remember what I needed. Paper notebooks are still great at this as you don&#39;t need to have a set format and can let the topic evolve as you see fit. They can be artistic, simplistic, scientific or just basic. What they don&#39;t offer though is the searchability and findability that a digital solution can offer and for me, that is where OneNote meets all that I need. With my Surface and pen, I can scribble notes as I do on paper, creating a page for each meeting but then quickly reference back either to that meeting through different notebooks or by searching for my scribbled text.</p>

<p>If you need to add more, such as when you need to take a photo from the screen, you can easily embed that photo in to your notes. When you realise that the order you wrote things is wrong, then you can quickly re-order the written notes. This is something I do regularly at talks and conferences to save time copying out exactly what is said. OneNote makes it easy to capture what you need and get back to it. So that&#39;s it, right?</p>

<h4>Following up on actionable tasks</h4>

<p>OK, that heading is a little tongue in cheek for fans of buzzword bingo. But the reality is that it has always been easy to take notes but to turn these in to things that you can track and make sure happen has always been harder. Some projects and teams set someone to track minutes for each meeting but this is not always natural for people and is easy to let slip. Someone takes the notes but then doesn&#39;t capture those tasks in to your task tracking tool.</p>

<h4>Did you know that in OneNote, you can now track an item as an Outlook task?</h4>

<p>Slightly confusingly, there are two versions of Outlook for Windows users - the core desktop version (OneNote 2016) and the Windows Store version (OneNote for Windows 10). If you are using OneNote 2016, then you have the option to set a to-do item and have this as an Outlook Task. Under the Home Menu, you can mark a line as being a To-Do task and then you can right click on that line to have it added as an Outlook task.</p>

<p><img alt="Adding an Outlook task in OneNote" src="/images/2017/05/Outlook-tasks-in-OneNote.PNG"/></p>

<p>Many people will see this and say that they don&#39;t like using Outlook but that is where To-Do comes in. Outlook tasks from Office 365 are now synced back to To-Do where it will be appear as a suggested task for that day. Tag it in OneNote and it will appear in your mobile app as your daily to-do!</p>

<p><img alt="Showing the task in To-Do" src="/images/2017/05/MS-To-Do.jpg"/></p>

<p>I had a great chat at the last #SUGUK session in London with Bill Ayers and Chris O&#39;Brien about capturing tasks in meetings and that spurned an idea to take a look at the OneNote API to pull through tasks given a specific notation. What I love is that it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as hard as that!</p>

<p>With the tasks in Outlook and To-Do, you can also set up a daily schedule in Flow for any items assigned to you for anyone who is more comfortable with using email for tracking items. I have also set up a Flow which picks up certain codes from a task and assigns it in to SharePoint to track actions rather than just having generic tasks for each person.</p>

<h4>So what is missing?</h4>

<p>While you can assign tasks to a SharePoint list, if you are a fan of Microsoft Teams and using Planner with it, there is currently not a way to trigger that using Flow. I think with the benefits of Teams integration, Planner will become more popular as a task tracking tool and I hope this will expand to be more available through Flow and Custom APIs. You could also use other tools such as Jira with Flow already if you are using them.</p>

<p>Given this, I think it would be great to have OneNote tasks pushing straight to Planner or other task tracking tools directly. Maybe this is where the API will kick in and could even be a future blog post...</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-05-11T17:37:19.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on from my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/why-you-should-build-components-and-connectors-for-your-intranet-not-a-gargangtuan-beast/">last post about building components for your Digital Workplace</a> and not just one big project, I looked in to how you could use bots to help find information across the workplace. The problem is that there are already a plethora of different bots out there and different teams will want to create different bots for their specific scenarios. While internal governance can help this, updating a single bot to deal with every scenario is just not sustainable. Microsoft Teams has addressed this by allowing you to side-load multiple bots and use @ mentions to chat with them. What I was looking for was to use this on a Digital Workplace hub page (aka Intranet homepage).</p>

<h4>Getting bots on to the homepage</h4>

<p>The first step was investigating how bots could interact on a web page. From the fantastic bot framework documentation, I found details of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/embed-chat-control-web-page">Web chat</a> tool (full details on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat">Github</a>) that allowed you to embed the a bot on to any site with some simple html. This worked well with a single bot but there was no way to extend this and dynamically change the bot that was in use.</p>

<p><img alt="Web chat" src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/media/chatwidget-client.png"/></p>

<h4>Back Channel to the rescue</h4>

<p>That&#39;s when my love of a good technical podcast kicked in. I was listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/richdizz">Richard diZerega</a> on the <a href="https://dev.office.com/podcasts">Office 365 Developer podcast</a> talking about Contextual Bots in SharePoint (episode 118). He referred to a <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/richard_dizeregas_blog/2017/02/15/sharepoint-framework-and-contextual-bots-via-back-channel/">blog post</a> that he had done on the subject and the Back Channel was the perfect route for a bot to be able to talk back to the bot channel and change details accordingly. This extended from the webchat project but allowed me to change the bot dynamically.</p>

<p>As this was going to be in SharePoint, I started off with a basic SPFX app in React. I chose React due to the larger number of samples available for SPFX, even though I was more comfortable in Angular. I also referred to the <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-bot-framework">React-bot-framework sample</a> from the SharePoint repo in a few cases when things went a little wonky!</p>

<h4>Creating the SPFX app</h4>

<p>I am intending to create a set of webparts that could be used in a Digital Workplace Hub page so set up the initial webpart under my <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Hollis">Hollis project</a>. Currently the webpart is called TheHubBot but I&#39;m working on renaming that - who needs more things called TheHub...</p>

<p>The code makes use of <a href="https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/directline3/#navtitle">Direct Line</a> to handle the calls to the Bot in a secure way so you will need to enable the DirectLine bot for any you use. The list of bots is held in the webpart configuration with the DirectLine ID for each used to talk to it.</p>

<pre><code>PropertyFieldCustomList(&#39;botList&#39;, {
              label: &#39;Bots&#39;,
              value: this.properties.botList,
              headerText: &#39;List of bots that can be queried&#39;,
              fields: [
                { id: &#39;Title&#39;, title: &#39;Title&#39;, required: true, type: CustomListFieldType.string },
                { id: &#39;DirectLineId&#39;, title: &#39;DirectLineId&#39;, required: true, type: CustomListFieldType.string }
              ],
              onPropertyChange: this.onPropertyPaneFieldChanged,
              properties: this.properties,
              context: this.context,
              key: &quot;botListField&quot;
            })</code></pre>

<p>The botConnection object is then subscribed for each of the bots configured in the list to listen to events from the bot itself. These events are filtered to look for any with an @ mention that matches the name of one of the bots. If these match, then it re-intialises the chat app with the new DirectLine Id.</p>

<pre><code>this.properties.botList.forEach((item, index) =&gt; {

  var botItem:IBotItem = this.properties.botList[index];
  botItem.InstanceId = this.context.instanceId;
  debugger;

  botConnection.activity$
  .filter(activity =&gt; activity.type == &quot;message&quot; &amp;&amp; activity.from.id == &quot;thehubbot&quot; &amp;&amp; activity.text.indexOf(&#39;@&#39; + botItem.Title) &gt; -1)
  .subscribe(a =&gt; {
      debugger;
    var act: any = a;
    var messageText = act.text;
    var botConnection = new DirectLine({
      secret: botItem.DirectLineId
    });

    var user = { id: &quot;userid&quot;, name: &quot;unknown&quot; };
    var bot = { id: &quot;userid&quot;, name: &quot;unknown&quot; };

    document.getElementById(botItem.InstanceId).innerHTML = &#39;&lt;div&gt;loading&lt;/div&gt;&#39;;
    // Initialize the BotChat.App with basic config data and the wrapper element
    App({
      user: user,
      bot: bot,
      botConnection: botConnection
    }, document.getElementById(botItem.InstanceId));
    console.log(&#39;Need to change the direct line bot&#39;);

    // Call the bot backchannel to give it user information
    botConnection
      .postActivity({ type: &quot;event&quot;, name: &quot;initializeBot&quot;, value: messageText, from: user })
      .subscribe(id =&gt; console.log(&quot;success initializing bot&quot;));
    }
  );</code></pre>

<h4>Writing the bot</h4>

<p>I started off writing the bot in NodeJS as I had written bots in this before but I found a few too many challenges when it came to having multiple bots hosted on the same website. This wasn&#39;t essential to the overall architecture but it meant that I could limit the number of Azure Web Apps I was going to spin up. If anyone has a solution for this with NodeJS hosted bots, I would certainly love to hear from you.</p>

<p>I built the bot using the Bot Builder SDK and following the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-quickstart">Getting Started guidance</a> in the Bot Framework documentation. All the code is available at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/HollisBots.</p>

<p>I started with the main Messages Controller which would act as the inital bot to call. This would take the initial queries and then root them through to the relevant bot. As this would need to be natural language so that people did not need to use a specific syntax, I used the LUIS service that is part of the Microsoft&#39;s Cognitive Services. LUIS stands for Language Understanding Intelligence Services and is the engine that takes a phrase and detects what the intention for that is. You define a set of &quot;intents&quot; for it such as &quot;How do I book leave&quot; or &quot;Where is the security policy&quot; and extracts that as a common query. This means that it can understand &quot;book holidays&quot;, &quot;how do I book holidays&quot; or &quot;how to book hols&quot; all as the same intent and route the bot to the appropriate answer. It can also extract entities from that so you could use it with Wikis to pull out the name of an application and send it to the right area within that, e.g. &quot;How do I log in to Phoenix&quot;. It would recognise Phoenix as an entity and pass that to your bot logic.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/">Luis</a> and even try it out yourself without any programming.</p>

<p>I used the Luis service at https://luis.ai to set up intents for each of my core bots:</p>

<p><img alt="Intents" src="/images/2017/05/intents.PNG"/></p>

<p>I have taken an export of these and placed in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/HollisBots/blob/master/HollisBots/The%20Hub%20Bot.json">github repo</a> if you want to use or just review. There isn&#39;t much detail right now but I will be adding further stuff.</p>

<p>I followed the Bot Framework documentation and had working a simple bot which matched the Intents and matched them to different bots:</p>

<pre><code>[LuisIntent(&quot;SearchPerson&quot;)]
    public async Task SearchPersonTask(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
    {
        await context.PostAsync(&quot;I will ask the @HubPersonBot: &quot; + context.Activity.AsMessageActivity().Text);
        context.Wait(MessageReceived);
    }

    [LuisIntent(&quot;SearchInformation&quot;)]
    public async Task SearchInfoTask(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
    {
        await context.PostAsync(&quot;I will ask the @HubInfoBot: &quot; + context.Activity.AsMessageActivity().Text);
        context.Wait(MessageReceived);
    }

    [LuisIntent(&quot;&quot;)]
    public async Task None(IDialogContext context, LuisResult result)
    {
        string message = &quot;Sorry I did not understand.&quot;;
        IntentRecommendation bestBet =  this.BestIntentFrom(result);
        await context.PostAsync(message);
        context.Wait(MessageReceived);
    }</code></pre>

<p>Anything that doesn&#39;t match get the default response at the end there. You will see that each matching intent returns a message saying that it will ask one of the bots with an @ mention. This is the mechanism that triggers the back channel. It could be asked directly if anyone knows how e.g. &quot;@HubInfoBot how do I book leave?&quot; but I wanted to make sure that people could use it without having to know the names of the different bots.</p>

<p>Each bot has its own Controller. They are fairly standard though with the main difference being the RoutePrefix - I will definitely be looking in to reducing the amount of code repeat in these.</p>

<pre><code>[RoutePrefix(&quot;/api/HubInfoMessages&quot;)]</code></pre>

<p>Currently, the individual bots are very simple but will be extended to talk back and forth with the various SharePoint APIs to pull information, especially the search API - that will be something for a future blogpost.</p>

<p>This was the core of the bots and it was not too much trouble to pull this together once the core elements were worked out. So what was harder then?</p>

<h4>Working out the security and hiding my keys</h4>

<p>Where I hit a lot of problems was how to add my code to Github without exposing the various keys involved. Much of the sample code has the Luis keys held in a LuisModel Attribute such as below from the bot framework documentation:</p>

<pre><code>[LuisModel(&quot;c413b2ef-382c-45bd-8ff0-f76d60e2a821&quot;, &quot;6d0966209c6e4f6b835ce34492f3e6d9&quot;)]
[Serializable]
public class SimpleAlarmDialog : LuisDialog&lt;object&gt;
{
    ...
}</code></pre>

<p>For the multi-authentication, I found a <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/issues/2258#issuecomment-280506334">great thread</a> in the BotBuilder issues that supplied a way to use a MultiCredentialProvider. This allowed you to supply multiple keys in the class and would then try and match each bot against these. I <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/HollisBots/blob/master/HollisBots/MultiCredentialProvider.cs">extended this class</a> so that the list of bots was held in web.config.</p>

<pre><code>    public static Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; GetBotList()
    {
        NameValueCollection section =
    (NameValueCollection)ConfigurationManager.GetSection(&quot;BotList&quot;);
        Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; botList = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
        foreach(string botName in section.AllKeys)
        {
            botList.Add(botName, section[botName]);
        }
        return botList;
    }</code></pre>

<p>I then removed the config from web.config in to its own file named web.botlist.config which I added to .gitignore so that it was not exposed. I have added comments to the web.config file to explain the correct format:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;BotList file=&quot;Web.botlist.config&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--
Add an entry for each Bot in a file named     web.botlist.config
&lt;add key=&quot;BotKey&quot; value=&quot;BotPassword&quot;/&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;/BotList&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This allowed each of the bots to be set up securely.</p>

<p>For the Luis config, I found this very hard due to my limited knowledge of Autofac. I read several threads that said this needed to be set up in the Autofac config but none of the examples worked outright. The best example I had to go on was the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/CSharp/Samples/AlarmBot">AlarmBot sample</a> from the BotBuilder repo. This mostly worked although I found that with my own custom intents, this didn&#39;t work consistently.</p>

<p>After many iterations, the version that I found worked was mostly around the code in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>if (activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
            {
                //await Conversation.SendAsync(activity, () =&gt; new Dialogs.RootHubInfoDialog());
                using (var scope = DialogModule.BeginLifetimeScope(this.scope, activity))
                {
                    //var postToBot = scope.Resolve&lt;IPostToBot&gt;();
                    //await postToBot.PostAsync(activity, token);

                    await Conversation.SendAsync(activity, () =&gt; scope.Resolve&lt;IDialog&lt;object&gt;&gt;());
                }
            }</code></pre>

<p>The original version from AlarmBot is commented out and never worked for me. Resolving around the IDialog&lt;object&gt; was the key change. Also, in the HubModule.cs, it register each of the Luis attributes from the config file:</p>

<pre><code>NameValueCollection section = (NameValueCollection)ConfigurationManager.GetSection(&quot;LuisList&quot;);
        foreach (string luisId in section.AllKeys)
        {
            builder.Register(c =&gt; new LuisModelAttribute(luisId, section[luisId])).AsSelf().AsImplementedInterfaces().SingleInstance();
        }</code></pre>

<p>For the Luis objects, they are registered in Autofac as:</p>

<pre><code>builder.RegisterType&lt;RootHubInfoDialog&gt;().As&lt;IDialog&lt;object&gt;&gt;().InstancePerDependency();
        builder.RegisterType&lt;RootHubNewsDialog&gt;().As&lt;IDialog&lt;object&gt;&gt;().InstancePerDependency();
        builder.RegisterType&lt;RootHubPersonDialog&gt;().As&lt;IDialog&lt;object&gt;&gt;().InstancePerDependency();</code></pre>

<p>This gave a nice working version that you can chat to. I will update this post with a video shortly.</p>

<h4>So what is next?</h4>

<p>The biggest work is to build out each of these bots with some sample content and get the bot searching SharePoint. However, first I would like to look at how I could integrate this in with the <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP/tree/master/Solutions/Business.StarterIntranet">PNP Intranet Starter</a>. This is a sample starter for an Intranet solution that I think could be extended further with more support.</p>

<p>For the main SPFX app, I would like to show a list of the bots configured on the screen and make it more obvious which bot you are talking to as well.</p>

<p>There are lots of updates coming out with Build 2017 so it will be interesting to see if any of those can be built in as well.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&quot;Empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve moreΓÇª.most importantly, not just celebrating any platform or technology of ours but celebrating what you can do with that technology to have broad impact.&quot; - Satya Nadella, May 2017</p></blockquote>

<p>Build is Microsoft&#39;s annual developer conference which is being held in Seattle as I write. Not everyone who reads this will be a developer so why should you care? Last year, they announced the Bot Framework and talked more about the HoloLens and the possibilities of augmented reality. They also talked about their newly released Cognitive Services and how it gave more access to AI. Looking back at the last 12 months, the growth in AI, bots and augmented reality has been massive. So why should you care about what developers are seeing? Because that is what you will be seeing very soon with 500 million active Windows 10 devices (twice as fast as Windows 8 growth).</p>

<h2>What were the hot topics this year?</h2>

<p>Intelligence and Bots are still very hot topics with the fruition of an extra year&#39;s worth of innovation showing up, most noticeably with the demo of live translation for PowerPoint presentations - more on this later.</p>

<p>Another big theme is the support for ISVs and others to publish their solutions out for people. There has been a common gripe with many of these new frameworks that they are only catered to developers and it is not easy to get these great solutions out to the people that need them - one of <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/here-is-what-i-think-is-going-to-be-announced-for-sharepoint-in-may/">my thoughts on what would be announced at the SharePoint Virtual Conference</a> talked exactly about this.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a lot more exposure to the extra set of hubs that Microsoft is putting in place to access all these services. Exposing more products (Microsoft and third party) in Teams and adding more to the Microsoft Graph to power everyone&#39;s own interfaces. This further opens up the capabilities that I think should be built for organisation&#39;s Digital Workplaces in my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/why-you-should-build-components-and-connectors-for-your-intranet-not-a-gargangtuan-beast/">earlier blog</a>.</p>

<h2>More AI for all</h2>

<p>The keynote had a demonstration of a new app for PowerPoint that automatically translates the speaker to up to 9 different languages. This has come from one of Microsoft&#39;s Garage projects and you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/project-details.aspx?project=translator-ppt">sign up</a> to be one of the early adopters.</p>

<p>While this is amazing, what is more impressive is that this is using the platform of cognitive services and so is something that others could have made - it is not using anything that Microsoft has not made available to others. The capabilities that this could bring are only just being thought of and could open up new ways of working.</p>

<h4>Bot Framework enhancements</h4>

<p>To help build these new ways of workings, Microsoft has opened up more ways of connecting with its Bot Framework.</p>

<p><img alt="New channels for Bot framework" src="https://blog.botframework.com/images/build2017/3_new_channels.png"/></p>

<p>The truly exciting news for enterprises is the Skype for Business bots. Many people I&#39;ve spoken to have been holding off working with the framework due to its lack of integration and I see this as being a large growth area. The management of these bots will be key to allowing this though with security teams still rightly nervous and devs must learn to see what can be used and what can&#39;t - for example, while I am a big fan of <a href="https://luis.ai">LUIS</a>, more information will be needed on where the data that is passed is used and held.</p>

<h4>LUIS LUIS</h4>

<p>Talking of LUIS, Microsoft has extended the number of intents that can be used and also introduced Phrase Lists. These allow a list of entities to be more easily defined and also suggests matching items e.g. a list of cities can suggest additional ones as well.</p>

<p>Enterprises will also appreciate the ability to manage multiple versions of your Luis application, allowing better managed deployments of changes and ability to test those changes. This is also supplemented with the Bot Analytics to see how your bots are being used.</p>

<h4>Adaptive cards for bot framework</h4>

<p>Adaptive cards will increase the UX of bots across multiple channels and reduce the inconsistency that has sometimes been seen with more complex bots.</p>

<h4>Custom models for cognitive services</h4>

<p>The final main part of the intelligence news are the custom models for cognitive services. The initial release of the services opened up a lot of capabilities but if your use case did not meet these, you were left with a far more complex scenario with your own machine learning algorithms. Services such as <a href="https://customvision.ai/">custom vision</a> have bridged the gap between the two, allowing you to hold your own trained models. Again, this will be of interest to enterprises who may have concerns about wider access to their own materials.</p>

<h2>More places to access your information</h2>

<p>There were more announcements around the popular Microsoft Teams with the ability to preview information from third party services without leaving the app.</p>

<p><img alt="Teams previewing info" src="https://blogs.office.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Office-at-Build-2017-1b.png"/></p>

<p>There is also further integration to the newsfeed for third parties and extensions now available in the App Store. This will open up easier access for people for more services.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Jeremy Thake <a href="https://twitter.com/jthake/status/862421327688290305">suggested that Teams will soon become the primary collaboration app for Microsoft ahead of SharePoint</a> and others certainly feel this as well. My view is that it will become another hub and some people will use this as the main area. However, Comms teams will still want their homepage, Sales people will still be focussed on their CRM and everyone will still have a homepage to land on when they open their browser. Things are changing but larger organisations still have many different ways of people working.</p>

<h4>Microsoft Graph enhancements - the glue that binds them</h4>

<p>What opens this up is the ever improving capabilities of the Microsoft Graph. I mentioned Content As A Service in my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/why-you-should-build-components-and-connectors-for-your-intranet-not-a-gargangtuan-beast/">last blog</a> and the news around the general availability of SharePoint Sites in the graph and also the Planner API mean that you can do more with the data in more places. The improved ability to connect to the graph from services like Teams and the Bot Framework using the newly announced MSAL will greatly improve the time taken to develop these services although I have heard mixed voices so far from those who have used it. I certainly found mixed experiences previously, especially when using with the Bot Framework and if it is not smooth for authenticated users, they will quickly find alternatives.</p>

<p><img alt="Graph roadmap" src="/images/2017/05/Graph-Preview.jpg"/></p>

<h4>Cortana Skills</h4>

<p>Cortana is still getting some good airtime and there are now new Skills to help it catch up with Amazon&#39;s Alexa. I have not seen many details of these skills yet to compare them but there is a lot to catch up on with Amazon. The difference may be the number of devices available for this and whether people can be encouraged in offices to start chatting to their computer more - something that remains to be seen so far.</p>

<h2>More in Store</h2>

<p>While there has been great work with the Teams extensions and the SharePoint Framework, it still takes a lot of work to use these for non-devs. With Teams Apps now available to be submitted to the Office Store and news coming today around SPFX, vendors can start to show off more of what they have been able to do. This will help enhance capabilities as companies stretch the capabilities further.</p>

<h4>News for non-devs too</h4>

<p>The other news is a store for Flow and PowerApps connectors. The custom story had already been improved but to open up for easy access for others will keep things moving.</p>

<h2>Great start, can&#39;t wait for more on Day 2</h2>

<p>There is so much content to digest and I am already hearing information appearing on the SPFX enhancements. This blog has already been delayed by my two week old baby and is being finished one handed while he&#39;s fed so time to wrap up for now!</p>

<p><img alt="one handed feed" src="/images/2017/05/one-handed-feed.JPG"/></p>

        <updated>2017-05-11T10:15:36.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the start of every year, the Nielsen Norman Group releases its <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-design/">annual report on the best Intranets</a> for that year but for many, the most interesting part is the analysis they release on the intranets. The part of this that I enjoy most is seeing the average time for creating an Intranet with this year&#39;s chart showing an average of 1.4 years. That is 1.4 years duration. Throw in the average team size of 12 people and assuming 8 hour days for 220 days a year, that&#39;s almost 30 000 person hours of effort. Just for that one release. For pretty much every company, that is a significant investment.</p>

<h3>Make the most of what you have already</h3>

<p>In many cases, companies will have many existing systems that teams use regularly and work well for them. Projects may be using Slack or Yammer to update on work and share the latest news and would be unlikely to change to share news on a new platform instead without good reasons. You could roll out improvements as a carrot to bring them across or push down from the top as a stick to force them across but a better way is to integrate that information instead.</p>

<h3>Keep it slim</h3>

<p>There is a natural feeling to make a new project as large and impactful as possible so that people feel that it is important and get on board with it. This is a natural human emotion as people feel that the bigger, the better. Buildings like the Burj Al Arab in Dubai and The Shard in London show that people remember huge structures and talk about them more so there is the temptation to do the same with your Intranet projects.</p>

<p>The problem is that this initial excitement and enthusiasm drops when it becomes too large and doesn&#39;t tie in to what you do. Hundreds of thousands of people take the train past the Shard in London Bridge every day and don&#39;t notice it at all now. If it offered useful information on train times or special offers then people would still gaze in its direction (although please, please know that I don&#39;t think this is a good idea at all!!!) and find it useful.</p>

<p>A thin Intranet homepage that integrates with what people use is the key. Relevant news and information along with links to connect them to relevant people and apps that they use will keep people coming back.</p>

<h3>So how can you surface all these different components?</h3>

<p>When you are talking about Intranets, the natural place to share links and integrations to all these different services is via the Intranet homepage. Many out of the box Intranet services based on SharePoint allow you to extend a list of apps for a user that can either be a simple link to another service or can add additional integrations. The basic link could be done with Office 365 using the launcher in the corner which will automatically learn from your most used apps and surface those. However, with a little development, you can extend this add your own notifications and prompts as you would expect with a mobile device. For example, show how many HR platform approvals you have or number of outstanding training materials you have to complete. This doesn&#39;t need to have the platforms re-worked but you can pull using existing APIs to show a summary and link directly to somewhere in that tool to action that.</p>

<h3>The API driven workplace</h3>

<p>The other area is to use those APIs in other areas and surface those notifications all over the place. Microsoft Teams is a good example of this. Bots also make this possible where either via your chat tool or with email, you can get responses where you work most. Microservices are allowing even more integration and with standardised security with tools like Okta and Azure AD among others, the complication of authentication and authorisation is reducing.</p>

<p>The key is to give people the flexibility to change and adapt. Don&#39;t force emails on people who don&#39;t use them - allow people to unsubscribe. If people aren&#39;t using Yammer, then they won&#39;t start using it just to receive news. Help people who are using the services well to communicate the benefits they see to others and this will increase the usage. Measure which areas are successful with this and back this - don&#39;t just assume that everyone wants the latest.</p>

<h3>So are you suggesting the end of the Intranet in a box?</h3>

<p>Absolutely not. There are great products out there like Add-In365, Powell365 and Valo Intranet that improve the experience of publishing news and other common features for sharing info. Phone directory, key events list, project spaces, job boards, buy/sell/rent and standard content pages can all get a great jump start with these products.</p>

<p>The problem becomes when these are seen as the only solution and everything must run through these. The phrase <a href="https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/">Content As A Service</a> has been growing in usage and covers that content can be captured in one place but used in many through APIs. The Intranet in a box can capture and maintain content well and also provide one endpoint but it should not be the only one.</p>

<p>Bots, voice services like Alexa, Chat services and mobile apps can all surface content. This follows on from the Hub and Spoke model and means that people get the right information where they use it. Outlook, Salesforce, Dynamics and others all have the ability to integrate info in to their main areas to show the content in the right hub for each staff member.</p>

<p><img alt="hub and spoke" src="/images/2017/05/Hub-and-spoke-diagram.PNG"/></p>

<h3>Things change so keep adapting</h3>

<p>The beauty of these flexible components is that you can maintain existing components while still bringing in new ideas. Monitoring the success allows you to gradual phase out unpopular components and build on the successful ones. In the personal space, people are more comfortable with the ever increasing change and updates taking place and this can now be supported in the workplace too. Communicate, support new ideas and keep what works going.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-06-20T21:18:40.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What does your day look like?</h2>

<p>Do you drive to work, head into your own or a shared office and get on with work? Do you have a desk in an open plan office, perhaps with hot desking? Or maybe you are on a laptop all day, moving between locations or sat at home keeping the cat off the keyboard? The nature of the workplace has shifted over the last twenty years with far more remote working and offices more likely to be open plan.</p>

<p><img alt="An open plan office - very open" src="/images/2017/06/open-plan-office.jpg"/></p>

<p>But it seems that there is a backlash building against open plan offices with <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=12347">studies</a> <a href="https://www.steelcase.com/research/articles/privacy-crisis/">noting</a> that there is a big dent to individuals productivity against the benefits of collaboration. It has even been noted that using headphones to concentrate does not completely help as the movement in people&#39;s peripheral vision still leads to distraction and loss of focus. Throw in a <a href="https://www.employeebenefits.co.uk/issues/february-online-2017/42-staff-overeat-eat-unhealthily-due-workplace-stress/">2013 survey from Canada Life</a> that found that people working from home had 70% fewer sick days than those in open offices and you have some serious considerations to make.</p>

<h3>So why have open plan offices?</h3>

<p>For the time being, I will gloss over the cost implications and think about the benefits to people of more open plan working. If you have a more open area, you encourage greater interaction and this helps foster better collaboration and also innovation. The <a href="https://thinkgrowth.org/what-the-ceo-of-kelloggs-taught-me-about-keeping-it-real-14a7acdc62be">CEO of Kellogs</a> also noted that it allowed the culture of a company to spread more effectively and foster greater connection between management and other staff as well as between different teams. Others can overhear when you&#39;re having issues and help out. Your team near you have better ideas on what you are working on and if it is related, can quickly bring ideas together. We can all live in one big happy family, holding hands and making the world a better place as there is nothing better than forcing innovationΓÇª</p>

<p><img alt="Disgruntled workers" src="/images/2017/06/disgruntled-workers.jpg"/></p>

<p>Apologies to non-British readers but I lapsed into too much British sarcasm here. Much of what I said is true but the reality also gets hampered by annoying habits of colleagues and people who have far more time for your job than theirs. The studies mentioned earlier found little evidence for the benefits of collaboration although the <a href="http://www.cmiworkplace.co.uk/well-designed-offices-improve-employee-engagement/">increased employee engagement through greater control</a> offers many benefits. For work to actually get done, there are times that you need to be able to just get on with what has been assigned to you.</p>

<h3>So that&#39;s some of the problems, what&#39;s solutions are there?</h3>

<p>As with many things, the solution is to find a balance. Companies internal real estate teams are realising that <strong>different people need different solutions at different times</strong>. Where the Digital Workplace has offered plenty of solutions for collaboration (such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint etc) and for staying focussed (https://medium.com/@producthunt/11-apps-to-help-you-find-your-focus-35dc52952af7), physical workspaces are evolving to become more flexible. This is not as easy with physical equipment but desks designed to not all be in rows and instead having areas where groups can be sat closer while other areas are more secluded. Smaller pods for private meetings or a bit of quiet focussed work. Electronic whiteboards or devices like the Surface Hub to collaborate
across locations and naturally in groups . Floor panels that allow power sockets to be more easily aligned to different desk layouts and increasing availability and security around wireless networks. All these are giving diversity to styles of office working that can adapt to a team&#39;s and organisation&#39;s needs over time.</p>

<p><img alt="Modern office example" src="/images/2017/06/modern-office.jpg"/></p>

<h3>Can I just work from home when I need to get things done?</h3>

<p>Many people find that working from home, even if the office is not too far away, allows them to focus more and get things done without distraction. When you have a large report to write, this can be a good way to remove some more of the distractions inherent to the office. However, one of the pioneers of large scale remote working, IBM, has recently <a href="https://www-foxbusiness- com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/05/18/ibm-pioneer-remote-work-calls-workers-back- to-office.amp.html">decided to bring their US remote workers back in to regional offices</a>. The benefits to employees and reduced office costs have been offset by the increasing lack of collaboration between team members. While digital tools can help bring people together, they are still not the same as being there in place and working on joint projects. Executives are beginning to look at these benefits which are not as tangible but bring greater innovation</p>

<h3>Can&#39;t the Digital Workplace solve all these issues?</h3>

<p>I love the Digital Workplace potential. I love being able to find relevant documents straight away. I love being able to chat and get trips booked online wherever I am, even if it is with a bot and not a human. I love organising when everyone is available by entering a few dates and letting people vote for the best. I love being able to find useful knowledge in one easy to search place for my clients when someone is not available.</p>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t mean that having the right tools mean that the right things will happen. Digital and physical workplaces are most effective when they are built around what staff in the organisation need to be most effective. It is important to communicate the potential but if your shiny new pods lay untouched and your Surface Hub shines on the wall with not one finger print on it while your paper flipboards are all used up, then that solution isn&#39;t for your organisation. If people are cramming round a small laptop touch screen on a regular basis while they share with a team in San Diego, then maybe it&#39;s time to get the sales guys from Microsoft in.</p>

<h3>So...collaboration...productivity...which wins?</h3>

<p>Does there have to be a loser? Keep employees engaged, give them options and make sure that they know how to use them. Clearly define expectations to people and ensure they have the right tasks to do and connections to the right people to do them with. There shouldn&#39;t be a loser then.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-07-13T09:37:19.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Feedback is great, isn&#39;t it? You get to know what people think and you can help improve your service, whether it&#39;s a Digital Workplace, custom application or customer services. Getting to know what the users of your service think is vital to making sure you offer a worthwhile service. Feedback should be easy to give and should be simple to be followed up on.</p>

<p>So what about in SharePoint? I love that with SharePoint Online, there is a bold feedback button at the bottom of many of the pages. It doesn&#39;t interfere too much and makes it easy when you find something you think could be better.</p>

<h2>So what&#39;s the problem?</h2>

<p><img alt="SharePoint Online feedback button" src="/images/2017/07/SharePoint-feedback-and-mobile-app.JPG"/></p>

<p>My issue with this is that the feedback goes straight to Microsoft. While it&#39;s great that they get that info, it&#39;s not obvious that it is going to Microsoft at all. Most users will think that they are providing some thoughts to their SharePoint team on how the site could be laid out better or maybe a typo on a news article. Instead, they are sending this up to someone who can&#39;t actually help with it.They get frustrated that nothing changes and the admins who can help don&#39;t get any the wiser.</p>

<h2>But there&#39;s a bigger problem...</h2>

<p><img alt="Privacy concerns" src="/images/2017/07/Gagged_by_Privacy.JPG"/></p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Hey Adam, did you know that the client ABCMNO Consulting has got their old logo on that page? The phone number should be 12345 and the main contact is John Smith.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>A helpful staff member has just fed back on a out of date page and shared what the latest info should be. This wings its way on to the user voice survey and is there for the whole world to see. This is private information on a company (a fictional one in the case above in case you hadn&#39;t guessed) and should be held so. For the many out there considering GDPR implications, this is a great example.</p>

<h2>Can we do anything about this?</h2>

<p>I have raised a <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/20072722-send-feedback-to-site-admins-first">User Voice</a> request to have feedback sent to admins first - it would be great to build some momentum on it. Feel free to add your feedback in the comments too, naturally!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This may be a shock to many people but SharePoint is starting to get beautiful. After many years of large lists on a page, never ending documents or acres of white space, SharePoint is focussing more on images. Not just that but it is now easier to upload an image without having to move between different libraries as you often did before.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEnQKzzbvfo">Communication Sites</a>, all this is changing. Large images are the way forward and easy to edit site layouts so most users can make a site look beautiful with some great examples on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CommSiteGallery?src=hash">#CommSiteGallery</a> hashtag on Twitter. However, if you don&#39;t have access to a great set of stock photos, how do you find the right content? That&#39;s where the Mcd79FindANewsImage webpart comes in - first though, here&#39;s the manual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>Not got Communications Site on your tenant yet? Check out <a href="http://sympmarc.com/2017/06/29/want-to-get-a-look-at-the-new-communication-sites-heres-a-trick/">Marc Anderson&#39;s great blog</a> to find a trick to enable it for some people. Or if you want to understand a bit about them, check out the <a href="https://en.share-gate.com/blog/sharepoint-online-communication-sites-explained">Sharegate blog</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Finding images for news pages</h2>

<p>I have tended to use three main sources for finding images - Bing, Google and Flickr. This is pretty simple to find specific things but it is important that you consider the licensing options for images. Below are three screenshots of how to set filters on the image search to ensure that you can re-use the license - make sure you read some of the details, depending on whether it is for commercial use or not.</p>

<p><img alt="Bing filtering" src="/images/2017/07/Bing-filtering.JPG"/>
<img alt="Google filtering" src="/images/2017/07/Google-filtering.JPG"/>
<img alt="Flickr filtering" src="/images/2017/07/Flickr-filtering.JPG"/></p>

<p>However, I have never found it quite as simple as that. For example, searching for collaboration brings all sorts of random things back. My favourite of the sources is Flickr as you get far more photos of real people that are more generic. Instead of just searching for collaboration, search around similar phrases like &quot;working together&quot; or &quot;togetherness&quot;. These less specific phrases tend to bring out more images and more options.</p>

<p>Also, use the filters to help get the right size and orientation for the image that you want. Landscape and panorama photos work best for a news page.</p>

<p>Susan Hanley also identified the following stock photo sites on her very useful 8 tips to get started with SharePoint Communication sites post.</p>

<ul><li>Pexels.com</li><li>Pixabay.com</li><li>Unsplash.com</li><li>Everypixel.com</li><li>Stocksnap.io</li></ul>

<p>This does still require you to download the image somewhere and then upload it to the site. In this world of automation, we should be able to do better than that.</p>

<h2>The Mcd79 Find a News Image web part</h2>

<p>The initial version is quite simple. Edit the webpart and you can open a search box to select an image. By default, it will search for the page title and bring back the first image. Once you choose the image and publish the page, it will also use this as the roll up image on the news listing page as well.</p>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IymUSZcnzCM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<p>It is a first version and plenty more that can be done with it. Currently, the Azure Function only uses Bing to search for images. I&#39;d like to expand this to Google and Flickr as well. More filters should be added so that you can select specific orientations and sizes and further details on the licensing. Finally, it would be great if it saved the image to SharePoint and referenced that to reduce cross site warnings.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the code on my <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79FindNewsImage">Github page</a> and I will be covering it in detail over the next few blogs.

        <updated>2017-08-01T22:26:28.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I promised in my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/fed-up-hunting-down-images-for-your-news-pages-in-sharepoint/">last blog</a> to follow up with some more details on how the image search wed part application has been created and so this is the first part, looking at how the Azure Function was been created. It would have been great to not need the Azure Function and have the web part call various image APIs directly. Unfortunately, the security is a far more important consideration and so an intermediary is needed. You could create a web api but Azure Functions open up a quick and easy way to wrap code securely and with minimal infrastructure (virtual or otherwise) to be set up.</p>

<p>Just before I get started on creating an Azure Function, I would like to apologise to anyone who tried to access my blog between 29 and 31 July. A few issues with what should have been a routine Ghost upgrade that took longer than hoped.</p>

<h2>Creating an Azure Function</h2>

<p>Much of what I followed was from the <a href="http://www.sharepointnutsandbolts.com/2017/04/calling-azure-function-from-sharepoint.html">insightful series of blog posts</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisO_Brien">Chris O&#39;Brien</a>, particularly the details on holding your code in Github and have that sync up to Azure.</p>

<p>There are three extensions that I would take for this:</p>

<h2>## #1 - Run functions locally</h2>

<p>Azure has made <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local">more capabilities</a> on this and you can now work on the function locally before deploying up to Azure. This makes it far faster to work on.</p>

<h2>## #2 - Update the function directly</h2>

<p>The code in the portal itself becomes read-only when you use Github (or another source control tool like Visual Studio Online) to sync but you can change this to read-write. This means you can quickly update the code during development - not the best practice but hugely useful. I found this even more useful when running PowerShell scripts as Azure Functions, opening up to IT Pros as well as developers.</p>

<h2>## #3 - Use a subfolder in Github</h2>

<p>Another useful change I found was that you can hold your Azure Function in a subfolder in Github so that you can have other applications in your repository as well, e.g. the SPFX webpart.</p>

<p>To do this, add a key called PROJECT to the Azure Function app settings and provide this with the Folder name or path.</p>

<p><img alt="Azure Function PROJECT App Setting" src="/images/2017/08/Azure-Function-PROJECT-App-setting.JPG"/></p>

<h2>## Quick note on pricing</h2>

<p>Using Azure Functions may put off a lot of people with the thought of having to purchase additional resources. The beauty of using Azure Functions is that they are very low cost. In fact, the first 400,000 GB/s of execution and 1,000,000 executions are free at the moment. You can view more details on the pricing at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/ but for all but the highest usages, it will be a low cost solution.</p>

<h2>Adding some image searching</h2>

<p>I had a few options for doing the searching but having had experience with using the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, I chose to start with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web">Bing Image Search</a>. In the future, I plan to give the option to search Google and Flickr as well.</p>

<p>The code to search Bing is relatively short. It uses HttpClient to pass the API key in the header and all the other details as query parameters:</p>

<p><code> var client = new HttpClient(); // Request headers client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(&quot;Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key&quot;, &quot;&quot;);// put your //key here var queryStringText = &quot;&quot;; queryStringText += &quot;q=&quot; + query; queryStringText += &quot;&amp;license=Share&quot;;</code></p>

<p>If you are using the code in Github, you will need to set the key at this line. There are further options for filtering the images which are currently commented out in the code but will be included soon to add more options:</p>

<p><code>/* aspectΓÇöFilter images by aspect ratio (for example, standard or wide screen images) colorΓÇöFilter images by dominant color or black and white freshnessΓÇöFilter images by age (for example, images discovered by Bing in the past week) height, widthΓÇöFilter images by width and height imageContentΓÇöFilter images by content (for example, images that show only a person&#39;s face) imageTypeΓÇöFilter images by type (for example, clip art, animated GIFs, or transparent backgrounds) licenseΓÇöFilter images by the type of license associated with the site sizeΓÇöFilter images by size, such as small images up to 200x200 pixels */</code></p>

<p>Next steps (for the next blog) were to use this function in a SharePoint Framework Web Part.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can read part 1 about <a href="Searching Bing with an Azure Function">Searching Bing with an Azure Function</a>.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s been a little longer than I&#39;d hoped, partially through business (job, new baby, bla bla bla) but also because in the time I have had, I&#39;ve been looking at adding some more features as well. These are around adding more image services (Flickr and Pixabay), some more filters so you have some choice around what is displayed and finally saving the image to a site. But first, how was it created.</p>

<h2>Yo SharePoint</h2>

<p>The first place to start is creating the framework. Support around this is great, both from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview">official docs</a> and the <a href="https://dev.office.com/pnp">PnP Community</a>. If you prefer a training course, then check out Andrew Connell&#39;s <a href="https://www.voitanos.io/">Voitanos</a> course.</p>

<p>The first step was to be able to show a static image. This is a nice quick change to the main component render method in FindANewsImage.tsx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div className={styles.helloWorld}&gt;
    &lt;div className={styles.container}&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img data-sp-prop-name=&quot;imageSource&quot; src={this.props.imageLocation.ImageUrl} width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The imageLocation property is based on an IImage object and is set in FindANewsImageWebPart.ts. Initially, I had this hardcoded and it neatly displayed on the page. However, it would not show the image on the roll-up page. After trying several different things, I eventually found that you needed to set the PreviewImageUrl property.</p>

<pre><code>protected get previewImageUrl(): string {
	return this.properties.imageLocation.ThumbnailUrl;
}</code></pre>

<p>This then showed the thumbnail in any news page roll-up:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/2017/11/News-rollup.JPG"/></p>

<p>The next step was to build out functionality to be able to search for the images. The way that I worked on this was to look at how Olivier Carpentier created custom fields which were used across the amazing SPFX40 examples:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OlivierCC/sp-client-custom-fields.</p>

<p>I used the PropertyFieldColorPicker.ts example and extended it with Office UI Fabric. All the data objects used are defined in IPropertyFieldImagePicker although there is quite a bit of tidy up needed in this. The actual search and rendering of the images takes place in IPropertyFieldImagePickerHost. A search is triggered whenever the text changes in the search box although with a delayed search:</p>

<pre><code>this.delayedImageSearch = this.async.debounce(this.performSearch, this.props.deferredValidationTime);</code></pre>

<p>The search function uses standard jQuery ajax calls to call the Azure function and return the images that match the query text. You can see an example in the video at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>private performSearch(value: string): void {
  let functionUrl = this.props.searchFunctionUrl;

  //console.log(&#39;Perform search:&#39; + value);
  var timeoutSelf = this;
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(&#39;timeout set: &#39; + value);
    var self = timeoutSelf;
    $.ajax({
        url: timeoutSelf.props.searchFunctionUrl + &quot;&amp;query=&quot; +  value + &quot;&amp;pixabay=true&amp;flickr=true&quot;,
        method: &quot;GET&quot;
    }).done(function (response) {
        var responseCount = response.length;
        //var response = JSON.parse(data);
        //console.log(response.value);
        self.props.initialValue.ImageUrl = response[0].ImageUrl;


        var oldValue
        if (self.state &amp;&amp; self.state.selectedImage) {
            oldValue = self.state.selectedImage;
        }

        self.setState({
            images: response,
            selectedImage: response[0] //default to selected image being the first
        } as IPropertyFieldImagePickerHostState);
        self.props.properties[self.props.targetProperty] = response[0];
        self.props.onPropertyChange(self.props.targetProperty, oldValue, response[0]);
        if (!self.props.disableReactivePropertyChanges &amp;&amp; self.props.render != null)
            self.props.render();
            });

    return &#39;&#39;;
  }, 1500);
}</code></pre>

<p>Clicking on the image saves it in to Site Assets and changes the image reference to that. This means that you have local control on the image rather than relying on a link to an external site. It uses blobs to upload the file using direct Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>private saveImageToSiteAssets(selectedImage: IImage): Promise&lt;IImage&gt; {
  var self = this;
  return new Promise&lt;IImage&gt;(resolve =&gt; {

  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
      if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200){
          //this.response is what you&#39;re looking for
          // just my logic to name/create files
          this.response
          var blob = this.response;//new Blob([this.response], { type: &#39;image/jpeg&#39; });
          var filename = selectedImage.ImageUrl.substr(selectedImage.ImageUrl.lastIndexOf(&#39;/&#39;) + 1) + &#39;.jpg&#39;;
          let web = new Web(self.props.context.pageContext.web.absoluteUrl);
          let siteAssetsFolderPath = self.props.context.pageContext.web.serverRelativeUrl + &quot;/siteassets&quot;;
          web.getFolderByServerRelativeUrl(siteAssetsFolderPath).files.addChunked(filename, blob, data =&gt; {
            console.log({ data: data, level: LogLevel.Verbose, message: &quot;progress&quot; });
          }, true).then(data =&gt; {

            let uploadedImage = {
              ImageId: &quot;&quot;,
              ThumbnailUrl: &quot;&quot;,
              Title: &quot;&quot;,
              ImageUrl: siteAssetsFolderPath + &quot;/&quot; + filename,
              LicenseDetails: &quot;&quot;
            };
            resolve(uploadedImage);
          });
      }
  }
  xhr.open(&#39;GET&#39;, selectedImage.ImageUrl);
  xhr.responseType = &#39;blob&#39;;
  xhr.send();

});
}</code></pre>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h2>So what is next?</h2>

<p>My next steps are to add even more providers. Bing, Flickr and Pixabay are currently there but there are a few more providers:</p>

<ul><li>https://api.everypixel.com/</li><li>https://pixabay.com/api/docs/</li><li>https://unsplash.com/developers</li><li>https://www.pexels.com/api/</li></ul>

<p>Before that, I need to add some filters so that you can choose which providers but also to provide some more checks. For example, some people may be happy to not search for only creative commons image or may want to only view widescreen images.</p>

<p>Talking of licenses, making sure that this meets most license requirements, I would like it to give the appropriate credits clearly for any images used. This will make it far easier to use images in multiple places and should save these details to the file list too.</p>

<p>There is plenty more to do and that could be done. If you have other ideas or things that you find an issue, please do chat to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk">Twitter</a></p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-12-16T21:17:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hit a very strange issue this week, one of those classic ΓÇ£this part will only take 5 minsΓÇ¥ but three hours later you are still on the same thing. The task was simple - delete all the folders in Shared Documents and replace with a new set. As I had a few sites to do, I wrote a PowerShell script using the ever helpful PnPPowershell. Then it errored on the first one with a message saying I had to delete each subfolder first.</p>

<p><img alt="Issue with having to delete all items in the folder" src="/images/2017/12/Retention-policy-issue.JPG"/></p>

<p>Odd, as I was sure I had been able to do this before. I did some Google diving on the exact message and many of the posts referenced the retention policies. This is one of the areas of SharePoint I havenΓÇÖt spent much time on before, especially online. I had heard issues with it being enabled incorrectly on OneDrive so wondered if it was related. We hadnΓÇÖt turned on SharePoint retention for the client but it may have been set by others.</p>

<p>I started in the site collection settings but nothing was set there so I went on to the Security Admin Centre. The only retention policy set was for all email so I moved on. Next step was to check other tenancies for the same issue but found nothing on my tenant or my Dev tenant. I found a bit more on retention policies and saw it created a library called the Preservation Hold Library. This existed on the Site with issues and a few others but I noticed that it didnΓÇÖt on the root site. Tried to delete full folders in the UI and it worked. Intriguing.</p>

<p><img alt="Preservation hold library" src="/images/2017/12/Prservation-hold-library.JPG"/></p>

<p>Soon I realised that the issue only occurred in Group Teamsites - classic sites and Communication sites were fine. It was time to return to the Security Centre and dig more on the policies.</p>

<p>What I found was that While SharePoint was not ticked under the email policy, Office 365 Groups were. Suddenly it all made sense. The policy extends to all supported elements of that group.</p>

<p><img alt="Retention policy applied locations" src="/images/2017/12/Retention-policy-applied-locations.JPG"/></p>

<p>Unfortunately at this point, I have the cause but not a solution as I need to be able to retain the Group mails. I deleted the folders by looping through and deleting each item but there will still be a user impact for this later on. Why does retention policy stop you deleting full folders? Why can you not exclude Group Teamsites from retention? Who is Snope and are they really ReyΓÇÖs parents? So many questions for Microsoft...</p>]]></content>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Why it is ok to use buzzwords and phrases but still hate them]]></title>
        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2017-12-16T23:10:16.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Digital workplace, artificial intelligence, big data, social intranets, the latest phrase out there - all of the key SEO words but do you know what they actually mean? Are you slotting these in to presentations and discussions with staff and clients and assuming they know what you mean by them? Are you hearing others use these in different contexts when meaning very different things?</p>

<p>These phrases take on a life of their own when they start to be used wider and wider and the original aim for what they were for can often be lost. So should you avoid using them and aim to be a lot more specific when it comes to what youΓÇÖre talking about?</p>

<h2>Catching people&#39;s interest</h2>

<p>What often changes is the fact that people donΓÇÖt know the details of the phrases. I work a lot in the digital workplace space and listen to a lot of discussion from people with plenty of experience like the <a href="https://digitalworkplacegroup.com">Digital Workplace Group</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/buckleyplanet">Christian Buckley</a> of <a href="https://collabtalk.com/">CollabTalk</a>, among others, and they have a good understanding of what they mean when they use the phrase and are clear on this. However, when talking with clients, they often have different expectations of the phrase intranet and digital workplace just sound like a fluffy thing where you will be sitting in a virtual reality room looking around with your headset on -not something they see happening so any time soon. As is right, they do not live their life reading about intranet and digital workplace and their understanding is sculpted by little snippets of info they have heard from others.</p>

<p>The reality, though, is that the world of work has changed a lot now, even if it is not immediately obvious. They work a lot more with their documents and their files from anywhere. Their applications are starting to move away from being Excel spreadsheets to PowerApps and other digital based media. Many organisations are really pushing away from their paper based forms, taking things like expenses to be tracked electronically from wherever you are instead of having to sign a piece of paper and hand it over. They are using the digital workplace, they just donΓÇÖt know it and they donΓÇÖt necessarily bring all the individual elements under the same umbrella. So the benefit of these buzzwords is to help bring each of these together for people to understand.</p>

<h2>The Future of Work</h2>

<p>The future of work will sneak up on many people, it wonΓÇÖt be a massive step change to what they do now. It will just be a gradual change and sneak in to what people are doing - then they look back on the way we worked was very different. So if you are out there and talking about digital workplace and artificial intelligence itΓÇÖs okay, yes. Yes artificial intelligence can be highly clever and complex to create but people can understand exactly what you wanted and take you to the right things. Or it could just be something that looks at the last few items youΓÇÖve opened and get your recent items from whatever device, as you do with Office 365. So itΓÇÖs easy to bunch a load of things together under artificial intelligence that may mean very different things as long as youΓÇÖre being more specific when you need to be.</p>

<h2>So are the trends for 2018 just a load of BS?</h2>

<p>Gartner recently released the trends for 2018 (https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3812063) and there are plenty of those buzzwords, especially as many of them seem to be exactly the same as last year suggesting nothing has changed. AI, digital, bots, blockchain - they are many of the same phrases that cropped up in similar reports last year. What is changing is that these are reaching people as real products rather than just ideas. There are articles (https://chatbotsmagazine.com/trends-driving-the-chatbot-growth-77b78145bac) highlighting (http://uk.businessinsider.com/chatbot-market-stats-trends-size-ecosystem-research-2017-10) the growth of bots and the amount that they are being used. The ever increasing price of bitcoin highlights the excitement about blockchain along with the new games starting to impact the speed of ethereum (https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609669/ethereums-first-killer-app-is-here-and-its-a-game-where-you-create-digital-cats/). These buzzwords aren&#39;t going away any time soon.</p>

<h2>You&#39;re still going to get annoyed</h2>

<p>You will still hear people talking about things they don&#39;t know much about. You will still hear people using phrases in completely the wrong way. You will still not know what some people are on about. Use the phrases to know that people are interested in these things and find out more. Find out the facts to back up the buzz and be ready to talk about it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the amazing people at Collab 365, my virtual conference presentation on building an intelligent Office Add-In using Cognitive Services is now available at https://collab365.community/using-cognitive-services-build-intelligent-office-add/. It covers how to build an Add-In for Outlook using the modern tools (good old Yo Office), how to bring in Cognitive Services for sentiment analytics and a little bit of SharePoint Framework at the end.</p>

<p>I always love feedback so please do let me know what you think. All the code is available at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/YouveGotSentiment and other links in <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/using-cognitive-services-to-build-an-intelligent-office-add-in/">my earlier post</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in April, I shared <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/here-is-what-i-think-is-going-to-be-announced-for-sharepoint-in-may-2/">my thoughts</a> on what would happen at the May SharePoint virtual conference and it&#39;s fair to say that I missed quite a few things! There&#39;s still no story about Publishing Pages (although the hub sites will cover quite a bit more than news will) and there&#39;s still not really any standardised bot integration. But there has been a huge amount taking place with SharePoint including my predicted increase in Flow and PowerApps integration and some huge improvements to the development lifecycle of SharePoint Framework later in the year.</p>

<p>The start of 2018 will bring about <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/SharePoint-hub-sites-new-in-Office-365/ba-p/109547">Hub sites</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-design-overview">site design templates</a> but what else do I think will appear?</p>

<p>Here is what I think will happen in the world of office 365 and SharePoint the next 12 months.</p>

<h2>Building on the modern foundations</h2>

<p>SharePoint has been held back by legacy back-ends for some time and these have often limited what could be changed. Coupled with many organisations and vendors building solutions that had requirements on keeping the services the same. However, with modern pages, this has changed. There has now been the chance to rework the SharePoint front-end and this has led to the opportunity to start again. New modern, responsive web-parts, a new development framework using modern web techniques, cross-platform apps with PowerApps and Flow to link it all together. It has taken some time to get to this point but now the foundation is ready, the chance will really be there to see what can be done with it. This year will see more built on that foundation with Hub Sites likely to be just the start. Some of the new features have felt a little half finished (e.g. news not available to be aggregated) but I think that this will quickly accelerate. I am hugely looking forward to what gets announced at the SharePoint Conference in Vegas and also how others make more use of these foundations.</p>

<h2>More intelligence powered services</h2>

<p>With tools like the designer in PowerPoint and the automatic CV creator in Word, there is a lot of growth of services building on Microsoft&#39;s Azure Intelligence services and helping people be more productive. Many of these will be simple and possibly used by a small percentage of users but all of these together will grow and grow the ease of use for all. I already find the ability to add questions from an email as a task with one click as essential to my day to day life and look forward to see what else will come. One area that will definitely improve is search.</p>

<h2>Search and governance</h2>

<p>Another huge area of growth that was signposted by Microsoft is in Search where I think that the ability to surface content relevant to the current user and powered by the growing expertise in machine learning will open up a much better basic search experience. There will always be the chance to create greater search experiences and tailored content with delicately set metadata. However, there has often been an issue with the amount of work needed to not only set this up but to keep it this way. For personalised content, this has led to a large amount of governance to ensure that metadata is set correctly and consistently.</p>

<p>Because of this,governance will re-emerge as a massive topic. I know, I know, many of you reading this are saying that it never went away which is true. However, the focus has been on getting content, regardless of how and where. Creating new pages, new teams, Yammer groups - all of these are more focused on ease of creation than management. Great for the end user but not for those administering content. Even with all the intelligence behind what content to show when, there will come a point where distinguishing the useful content from the duplicates and what remains relevant event when it is old becomes too hard with the current solutions. This will lead to either greater governance capabilities as a core service or vendors to quickly fill that gap. Having the right content will be key and vendors like Hyperfish make it easier to get the right content in the right place.</p>

<h2>Vendors around Microsoft 365 will grow massively, be swallowed up or vanish</h2>

<p>As the foundations change around Office 365, the push on vendors to adapt will become greater. Some vendorΓÇÖs will fall by the wayside as Microsoft offers services to compete with them like the migration tool but others like AvePoint, ShareGate and Metalogix will still be there and will come up with new and interesting solution is to keep people keen and to fill the gaps that exist.</p>

<h2>A new challenger?</h2>

<p>I think Microsoft has done a great job in keeping Office 365 as a key challenger in many different areas. However, I think that there is a chance of something new disrupting the space. Salesforce acquired Quip last year as a disruptor to collaborative services and Slack has shown what is possible as well. I think that some time this year, there will be a challenge across a wider spectrum of the Office capabilities.</p>

<p>At the same time, the excitement and hype around Microsoft Teams will ground out in some reality. However, it will be continued growth of reality with it taking even more of a centre stage. Especially as people in the enterprise move off Skype For Business and start to accept Teams as the new way of working</p>

<h2>New ways of inputting will finally make ways in the enterprise</h2>

<p>Amazon made the first big jump ahead of Microsoft with their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/amazon-is-putting-alexa-in-the-office/">Alexa for enterprise</a> at the end of this year. This will finally see people accepting the ease with which some services can be improved with voice. Taking actions and notes from a meeting, organising leave and other consistent processes, coupled with search to find the right content. Will it become something that people all grumble about? Oh, certainly it will. It will become an easy target for how &quot;these bots will never take over&quot; but it will gradually take hold and acceptance will grow in the way that SharePoint has taken hold.</p>

<p>The voice input will also be backed up by the bots explosion where developers realise the ease of use of giving access to their services and users realise that not clicking and typing can be much easier. More and more people in the modern workplace travelling around will open up the need for faster access without keyboards as I often find the need to take notes and reply to emails while in the car. Hopefully next year, this will finally be rounded off as a complete service.</p>

<h2>In the development world</h2>

<p>After the rise and rise of React, Angular Elements will finally give Angular a leg back in. There are so many devs who feel more comfortable with Angular that I see this growing back in to being the framework of choice again. With Elements, it will meet the needs of being the newest toy on the block but also back up people who have dabbled with Javascript frameworks without going fully JS. Once a few start backing this, the examples will be there and it will be the new challenge.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>More new stuff coming, the old stuff staying around but looking shinier than ever AKA same most years recently! But I am looking forward to it and it feels full of opportunity for all.</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>

        <updated>2018-01-13T11:01:36.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a challenge recently where someone wanted to be able to show an Outlook calendar on a board with everyone&#39;s assignments on it. It sounded like a common thing to do but while there was the Journal view, that could only show a day or two at a time - they wanted to see what people were up to for that week. We tried a few different ideas but I kept coming back to PowerApps. I knew you could connect to Outlook so it seemed the right place to start and be able to customise without a full development project needed.</p>

<p>I started with pulling back my own calendar and had that showing nicely. I used the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365/">Office365 connector</a> from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/">list of connectors</a>. I added a gallery to show the items and then used ClearCollect to pull the data in to a collection that the gallery was linked to:</p>

<p>ClearCollect(CalItems, Office365.GetEventsCalendarViewV2(&quot;AQMkCDgyOTgxOTFlLWIxYTujNDgwMS04ZmQ0LWUwZmQ4Zjk0YWIzMABGAAAD2RtBjD8Jk0i4KA3NAvHSRAcAnklFNo4RR0yOoHVpIVJ1nQAAAgEGAAAAnklFNo7CC0yOoHVpIVJ1nQAAAhjZAAAA&quot;,&quot;2018-01-01&quot;,&quot;2018-02-01&quot;,{}).value)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/2018/01/Initial-PowerApp-screenshot.JPG"/></p>

<p>So this was lovely and all worked. Next I thought, let&#39;s try with an Office 365 Group calendar.....hmmm, how would that work? I checked the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365groups/">Groups preview connector</a> but there was no way to get a calendar. I used the Microsoft Graph Explorer to see if I could get an ID for the calendar in the graph but while I could get a Group ID, there was no way to get a calendar ID. However, in the graph API, I could see that you could return events for a group - bingo! Surely it would be easy to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/softwaresimian/2017/10/05/using-postman-to-call-the-graph-api-using-azure-active-directory-aad/">create a Swagger file for the graph using Postman</a> (thanks to Software Simian aka <a href="https://twitter.com/ross_p_smith">Ross Smith</a>). I did all this and created a custom connector with this in the PowerApps web version. Then I added this connector to my app and I had the events from the Group calendar. I was finished!....</p>

<p>...or so I thought. Because when I tried to filter the items by date to have a gallery per day, I found that it wasn&#39;t returning start or end date. With PowerApps now, you can view a collection so I had a look at the one I was returning.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/2018/01/PowerApps-created-date-and-end-date.JPG"/></p>

<p>Created Date came back fine but the end date was an object so I went deeper:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/2018/01/PowerApps-blank-end-date.JPG"/></p>

<p>The timezone was coming back but no actual date. I went back to the Custom Connector and ran a test against the API:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/2018/01/Custom-Connector-Response.JPG"/></p>

<p>The start dateTime was being returned but I noticed that it was in a different format and that is where I have hit the brick wall. I have tried changing the Swagger file to treat this as text but the schema validation fails saying that it found a datetime format instead. <a href="https://twitter.com/mlafleur">Marc La Fleur</a> has kindly offered to take a look so this blog is largely for him to take a look but anyone else who has some ideas would be very welcome! Below is the Swagger file I used with the Group ID removed.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When working in the digital workplace and making proposals, there are often times where you need to show some content on your site. The go-to content for this has been Lorem Ipsum for quite some time (over 500 years if this article about the <a href="http://www.loremipsum.de/about_lorem_ipsum.html">history of Lorem Ipsum</a> can be believed) but what about when you want something a little different?</p>

<p>Here are my favourite client friendly versions that work as of March 2018:</p>

<h2>Corporate Ipsum</h2>

<p>A splurge of corporate speak like <em>&quot;Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.&quot;</em></p>

<p>http://www.cipsum.com/</p>

<h2>Space Ipsum</h2>

<p>One for all the space fans out there (<a href="https://twitter.com/andrewconnell">Andrew Connell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/c_f_johnson">Chris Johnson</a>, I&#39;m looking at you) and want some space based content like <em>&quot;Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed. As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereΓÇÖs a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest. NASA is not about the ΓÇÿAdventure of Human Space ExplorationΓÇÖΓÇªWe wonΓÇÖt be doing it just to get out there in space ΓÇô weΓÇÖll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who wonΓÇÖt be able to go.&quot;</em></p>

<p>http://spaceipsum.com/</p>

<h2>Social Good Ipsum</h2>

<p>Looking for some socially responsible corporate waffle type content? Look no further than <em>&quot;Program areas social enterprise transparent collaborate external partners effective replicable. Collaborate thought leadership challenges and opportunities compassion overcome injustice shine. Data issue outcomes; support, and indicators compassion issue outcomes social entrepreneur. Impact investing initiative global, problem-solvers; best practices program areas. The human-centered, policymaker; uplift theory of change capacity building. Leverage contextualize academic empower communities accessibility overcome injustice. External partners and indicators change-makers inclusive correlation. Shared value resist, or strategy correlation resilient to when. Milestones technology natural resources initiative citizen-centered social capital. NGO problem-solvers ideate; dynamic, living a fully ethical life thought leader rubric inclusive compassion. Systems thinking, transparent, compassion, empower communities venture philanthropy best practices. Silo effective bandwidth; rubric data social intrapreneurship. Triple bottom line data; but thought partnership, effective altruism social enterprise strengthening infrastructure strategy. Or, compelling move the needle impact investing, indicators transparent empower communities social enterprise. Data silo strategy social entrepreneurship co-creation; boots on the ground relief.&quot;</em></p>

<p>http://socialgoodipsum.com</p>

<h2>Office Ipsum</h2>

<p>Need some content to show meeting notes or client notes for a demo? Office Ipsum has some classics like <em>&quot;I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer for this was not according to brief. Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution can you make pink a little more pinkish, yet try a more powerful colour. The hair is just too polarising. I trust you. Thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix make it pop I think we need to start from scratch, for we exceed the clients&#39; expectations but we have big contacts we will promote you. Needs to be sleeker the hair is just too polarising, so can it be more retro.&quot;</em></p>

<p>http://officeipsum.com/index.php
You can also get the classic Lorem Ipsum from there too.</p>

<h2>The Post Modern Generator</h2>

<p>Intriguing generator that creates essays from recursive grammars - a machine learning Lorem Ipsum you could say. <em>&quot;The main theme of McElwaineΓÇÖs[4] analysis of capitalist
situationism is not theory per se, but posttheory. Lyotard uses the term
ΓÇÿneocapitalist nationalismΓÇÖ to denote the difference between sexuality and
sexual identity. It could be said that the subject is contextualised into a
capitalist situationism that includes truth as a totality.&quot;</em></p>

<p>http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/</p>

<h2>Trollem Ipsum</h2>

<p>Finally a more entertaining one designed to generate content to troll other technologies. I included this one purely on the basis that it described Apple lovers as fanboys and Microsoft lovers as apologists. Here&#39;s the <a href="https://twitter.com/thurrott">Paul Thurrott</a> generator: *&quot;Anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years, on the whole I love Microsoft with all my heart, soon eventually the competition will catch up with Apple nevertheless 2011 is the year for Microsoft, after Netbooks outsold iPads, moreover 2010 is the year of netbooks. They need to fix the iPad, in addition better as a 7ΓÇ¥ model next the Dell DJ is an iPod killer, until no doubt Apple will finally do something about that. Innovative Windows Phone, as well as Apple should close their stores, finally 2011 is the year of Windows Phone prior to they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them on the iPhone 4S is nothing special so as to the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales, in order that Time Machine rips off MicrosoftΓÇÖs Volume Shadow Copy Service.</p>

<p>2012 is the year of the Ultrabook suddenly so-called media tablets.&quot;*</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you follow SharePoint news, you undoubtedly would have heard about Hub Sites. They were announced at Ignite in 2017 and have been causing a ripple of excitement ever since. Why? The big reason many people have often felt that SharePoint has lacked tools as standard that help to build a true Intranet. Rolling up news, connected sites, common navigation - all these things were possible in SharePoint but required a good bit of work to function well. Vendors have filled the gap in the past with some great digital workplace products like <a href="https://www.addin365.com/">Add-In 365</a>, <a href="https://www.valointranet.com/">Valo Intranet</a> and <a href="https://www.powell-365.com/en/">Powell 365</a> but many organisations did not want to make the additional investment required.</p>

<p><img alt="Cogs" src="/images/2017/03/cogs.jpg"/></p>

<h2>All about the hubs and spokes</h2>

<p>I spoke in <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/here-is-why-microsoft-teams-is-vital-to-cut-down-a-cacophony-of-collaboration-tools-2/">an earlier blog</a> about the importance of hubs and spokes to the digital workplace, allowing people to work in the way that they want but being connected to all the services that they need. At the time I was talking about the impact of Microsoft Teams as a new hub but areas of an organisation still look for their own hubs. That is where Hub Sites play in to this new world.</p>

<p>HR want to show where they can provide assistance to staff and help people to help themselves. Finance want to give access to key reports and data to those who should be allowed access to it. The Project Management Office want to have a single place to show the status across their portfolio of projects. In that last case, each project would often have its own site but there can be the need to link those with a common navigation and have news from each roll up.</p>

<p>This is where Hub Sites come in.</p>

<p><img alt="Test Hub Site" src="018/03/Test-Hub-Site-1.PNG"/></p>

<p>A Hub Site is not that different from the modern team site or communication site and getting started with a hub site requires you to first create one of these. At this point, we hit one of the big issues currently with Hub Sites - you need to be an admin and to be comfortable with a little PowerShell to be able to elevate a site to be a Hub Site. It&#39;s a pretty simple command (shown below) but this closes it off to a smaller set of people who can do this.</p>

<blockquote><p>Register-SPOHubSite https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HR</p></blockquote>

<p>Associated other sites to a hub site is a much easier affair. From the cog menu, select Site Information and you will see a new option appear - as an aside, this has been the easiest way to check whether hub sites are available in your tenant.</p>

<p><img alt="Site info" src="ite-info.PNG"/></p>

<p>The associated site will inherit a navigation bar with a common logo and the same navigation items. Sites that are associated do not get automatically added to the navigation and links must be manually added. There is also some time taken from adding items to the menu before it appears on the other sites, up to 10 minutes from experience at the moment.</p>

<p><img alt="Common navigation" src="ommon-navigation-1.PNG"/></p>

<p>News will also roll-up from other sites on to the hub site. There isn&#39;t any control of approving the news and you can&#39;t filter using the standard News web part at all. But to bubble up news automatically, it works well.</p>

<p><img alt="News roll-up" src="-up.PNG"/></p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>So are Hub Sites living up to the excitement? Partially. They look great and are starting to bring some much needed functionality. However, it feels a little early to get too excited. They will evolve and the rapid release cadence that Microsoft is on means that they will improve rapidly. This feels like a start rather than a fully featured product and if that is the case, then it is a good start. Giving some more control to what goes where and allowing end users control without PowerShell would be a great improvement. There are some hints as to what is coming with cross-posting and pinning of news suggested in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-AMA/bd-p/SharePointAMA">Hub Sites AMA</a> which took place last week and there will be even more being announced in May at the SharePoint Conference North America.</p>

<p>So a thumbs up for what is there now and hope that there is much more to come.</p>]]></content>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrating my new blog with thoughts on Build 2018]]></title>
        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-05-13T20:13:01.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a year with a Delve based theme to my blog, I thought that it was time for a change, adding a little more to the template. And what better way to show that off than with my thoughts from the recent Build conference.</p>

<h2>Another year of evolution instead of revolution</h2>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that I was completely disappointed but there was nothing that really surprised me this year. Lots of interesting updates appeared but nothing truly earth shattering. Many of the announcements had been trailed beforehand so while it was good to see the details, it was not a shock.</p>

<h2>AI for the masses is here to stay</h2>

<p>While Microsoft are still going to continue with their machine learning tools, they see that where the real benefits lie is with making it easy for developers to use the services. There were more announcements around Cognitive Services at Build but also the open sourcing of Azure IoT Edge Runtime. The announcements around IoT were designed to make it easier to run the AI and machine learning on smaller devices and to bring the power to where it is needed. The partnership announced with DJI shows that Microsoft is taking the drone world seriously - Future Decoded showed an example of this last year where drones were being used to detect problems with power lines and there is much more opportunity for similar scenarios.</p>

<p>Read more at https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/07/microsoft-open-sources-azure-iot-edge-runtime-embraces-more-kubernetes-partners-with-dji-and-qualcomm/ and https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/what-s-new-with-azure-iot-edge/.</p>

<p>Also evolving is the ability to run custom machine learning models on Windows 10 having built them in Azure. This opens up the possibility of running huge processing on massive volumes of data (whether it be documents, images or videos) and run much smaller models on lower power devices. Using powerful GPU or even FGPA driven servers in the cloud, you will be able to process large volumes of data for your models and then run them on a Raspberry Pi, building in image detection or text scanning.</p>

<p>Read more at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ai-platform-announcements-new-innovations-for-developers/.</p>

<h2>Kinect is back</h2>

<p>This was a real surprise to me as I thought that Microsoft had decided to kill off the Kinect brand which I found a real shame. I played around with Kinect development a few years ago and found it very powerful so I am excited to see it return. It is backed now by the Azure AI cloud tools to offload much of the processing of what it sees. I expect to see far fewer games but far more useful gesture based applications being build from it.</p>

<p>Read more at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-project-kinect-azure-alex-kipman/?irgwc=1 or https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/perception.</p>

<p><img alt="kinect" src="/images/2018/05/kinect.jpeg"/></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality Apps</h2>

<p>HoloLens isn&#39;t going away any time soon and while it has not yet truly found its way as a mass market device, it is forming useful niches. The focus from Microsoft on Firstline Workers makes the benefits of handsfree collaborative working more important and HoloLens will form a key part of this, either in its current guise or in future versions as they evolve.</p>

<p>Build announced two new apps to support this:</p>

<ul><li>Layout - import 3-D models in to the app and use them to lay out in a real world scenario e.g. see how new stands could appear in a shop.</li><li>Remote Assist - allows firstline workers to easily reach out to experts and share issues using the HoloLens video sharing e.g. an engineer struggling with a task could ask for help from a centrally located specialist team immediately instead of waiting for them to travel in.</li></ul>

<p>These apps are interesting but it is more important to see new capabilities being developed with HoloLens as a tool - keep watching this space.</p>

<p>Read more at https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/05/07/introducing-two-new-mixed-reality-business-applications-microsoft-remote-assist-and-microsoft-layout/</p>

<h2>Collaborative coding with Visual Studio Live Share</h2>

<p>One service announced at Build and now available is the ability to live collaborate on code using not only Visual Studio 2017 but also Visual Studio Code. Similar to using Skype for Business screen sharing where you can work on the same code at the same time but with the added benefit that any party connected can view other areas, not just the one the person is sharing. With pair programming still being popular, this will allow pairs to do the same tasks while not necessarily being physically located together.</p>

<p>It is hard to say how much I can see this being used. I often do code reviews and discuss work done on code with others, both others and my own code. Will I use this for it? I&#39;m still not sure if this really adds more benefit than a simple screen sharing session but will certainly be giving it a try.</p>

<p>Read more at https://www.visualstudio.com/services/live-share/.
<img alt="visual-studio-live-share-screen-1200x458" src="018/05/visual-studio-live-share-screen-1200x458.jpg"/></p>

<h2>.Net Core 3.0</h2>

<p>We are finally seeing .Net Core take the jump to the UI rather than just being backend or web code. While it won&#39;t be live until 2019 (with a preview in 2018), it will offer UWP, WPF and Windows Forms implementation for Windows desktops, increasing performance and allowing much easier deployment - no need to have to install a full .Net framework first before running the application, it will all be rolled in to the app itself.</p>

<p>What is disappointing with this at the moment is that the UI will only work on Windows, breaking one of the major benefits of .Net Core being cross platform. This may change later down the line but it feels like a kick in the teeth as Electron and other frameworks which make it easier to create Progressive Web Apps that work on many platforms.</p>

<p>Read more at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/.</p>

<h2>Modern Meetings</h2>

<p>Meetings feel like they haven&#39;t changed much since the advent of video conferencing took hold but thankfully Microsoft has given a sign of things hopefully to come. Being able to automatically transcribe meetings and assign actions to be tracked afterwards will help remove much of the unnecessary overhead of meetings. The technology is all now there and hopefully it can be harnessed together effectively and productively for all.</p>

<h2>Openshift on Azure</h2>

<p>While not an area that I have touched on much, the big news here is that Azure is the only cloud platform with the partnership with Red Hat to offer a fully managed and engineered version of OpenShift. I&#39;m sure Google and Amazon won&#39;t rest on their laurels but it is great to see yet more signs of the new Microsoft opening itself up to new areas.</p>

<p>Read more at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/openshift-on-azure-the-easiest-fully-managed-openshift-in-the-cloud/.</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>I may have sounded negative at the start about Build but it was an indication that Microsoft are still travelling in the right direction. Opening up to many platforms, embracing the potential of AI and Machine Learning, supporting developers to deliver on requirements and preparing for an augmented reality explosion all help developers in the Microsoft space feel pretty confident right now.</p>]]></content>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring creating SharePoint TeamSites using SiteDesign and the REST API]]></title>
        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-07-21T08:40:40.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been recently exploring creating sites with Flow off the back of a list. I&#39;d done this previously with Azure Functions very successfully but wanted to see if Site Scripts and Site Designs could remove that extra step. TLDR? Yes you can!</p>

<p>There are some great posts on creating Site Scripts and Site Designs (see additional links at the bottom of the page) but the basic one on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/get-started-create-site-design">Microsoft Docs</a> gets things going pretty quickly.</p>

<p>So how does Flow create the site? Creation of a Team Site using REST does not appear to be that well documented and I couldn&#39;t find any examples of creating a site with a site design in one step. This was a little odd so I took a look at what calls the main SharePoint page uses to create a site and the key appeared to be:</p>

<p><code>_api/GroupSiteManager/CreateGroupEx</code></p>

<blockquote><p>Massive caveat here - as these APIs appear to be minimally documented, they may be subject to change at short notice.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are a few examples of using this out there (try <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=creategroupex&amp;oq=creategroupex&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i59.2184j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Googling CreateGroupEx</a>) that allowed you to pass the DisplayName, the Alias, whether it is public and even some that covered classification. However, I couldn&#39;t find any that passed anything to set the Site Design ID. Thankfully, Chrome came to the rescue and I found that it was passing the JSON below.</p>

<p><code>{ &quot;displayName&quot;:&quot;@{triggerBody()?[&#39;Title&#39;]}&quot;, &quot;alias&quot;:&quot;Project-@{triggerBody()?[&#39;ID&#39;]}&quot;, &quot;isPublic&quot;:false, &quot;optionalParams&quot;:{ &quot;Description&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;CreationOptions&quot;:[&quot;implicit_formula_292aa8a00786498a87a5ca52d9f4214a_03dac6d2-3e91-4f43-9163-953ce1bf7616}&quot;] } }</code></p>

<p>A little bit of time later (and some swearing too...) I realised that the later half of the implicit_formula section was in fact the Guid of the Site Design. Once I had this I was away and running.</p>

<p><img alt="Returning-Site-Design-List" src="/images/2018/07/Returning Site Design List.PNG"/></p>

<p>I created a Flow that triggered from a SharePoint list containing the list of projects. It first retrieved the list of Site Designs to get the Guid - I could have hardcoded this but wanted to allow it to be more user friendly and retrieved by name, matching what the user would do. It then iterates through the designs until it found the matching one and made the call to CreateGroupEx.</p>

<p><img alt="Create-Project-Site" src="018/07/Create Project Site.PNG"/></p>

<p>The REST API calls were made using the relatively recent SharePoint activity called &quot;Send an HTTP request to SharePoint&quot; which meant that there was no need to work with any tokens or credentials.</p>

<p>There are still many cases where you would need some additional scripting that would require the PnP provisioning templates for more advanced scenarios and so would use an Azure Function but for situations where you don&#39;t want to have to have an Azure subscription (it can take months for some enterprises to agree that this is something that should be set up) then this is a good alternative. <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisO_Brien">Chris O&#39;Brien</a> covers some great scenarios in his SharePoint Nuts and Bolts post below.</p>

<p>Happy site creating (but don&#39;t forget the <a href="http://bostonmusicdave.com/balancing-self-service-with-governance-and-control-in-office-365/">governance</a>...)!</p>

<p>p.s. Yes, I know I&#39;ve been quiet on here. Sorry. Life, work, kittens. All got in the way.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here&#39;s a challenge for me to finish the year - one blog per day throughout advent! It&#39;s a leap of faith but this blog has been neglected for too long so I will clear out some of my backlog and cover thoughts on Digital Workplace, Digital Homeplace and some of the places that Microsoft 365 helps to fill that out.</p>

<p><img alt="Leap of faith" src="pg"/></p>

<p>My first post is on focus and productivity. I have written before on <a href="http://www.mcd79.com/2017/06/20/remote-working-and-open-plan-offices-productivity-vs-collaboration-2.html">open plan offices</a> and the trade off around productivity and collaboration. What are the tips that I use to stay focused?</p>

<h2>Three tasks per day</h2>

<p>I wrote previously about my <a href="http://www.mcd79.com/2017/03/07/stay-productive-creating-a-three-daily-tasks-app-in-powerapps-and-flow-2.html">PowerApp to focus on three tasks every day</a> and I still use this technique although slightly adapted to use <a href="http://www.mcd79.com/2017/04/19/microsoft-helps-you-stay-productive-with-to-do-2.html">Microsoft To-Do</a> now. Before the daily stand-up, I will note any meetings I have that need work before them as a priority and any deadlines that are due that day. Then using To-Do&#39;s built in &quot;My Day&quot; function, I can set aside a realistic set of three tasks and tick them off as they are done. I set them in priority order and add a couple of nice-to-haves after those. The nice-to-haves should be something that&#39;s a benefit that may get you ahead but not necessarily something that will be top priority the next day. Sadly blog posts usually sit in this never ending bucket!</p>

<h2>Noise cancelling headphones</h2>

<p>The benefits of an open plan office are over hearing what is happening and getting a greater understanding of what others are doing. However, there are times when you just need to get on with things. I am often lead off to other minor tasks when I hear others talking about something and my mind gets distracted by thinking about their issues instead. My <a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html">Bose QC-35 IIs</a> let me focus on one thing, usually with some great repetitive classic dance music (Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx and Orbital are favourites here) or even something heavier (Pantera, Slaves, IDLES) when I need to get a move on. Tailor the music to the mood but I find that something less hummable along to keeps me focussed on the work.</p>

<h2>Make the most of travel time</h2>

<p>Time in the office is usually not great for catching up on the latest news and in a cloud focused world where things are moving faster than ever, keeping up is essential. To balance this out, I use my commute to and from work to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. These help me with distraction from overthinking my current project and encourage the brain to have some balance.</p>

<p>My first recommendation from these is the book Organised Mind by Daniel Levitin, talking about information overload and how to deal with it. There are so many great topics in here about how the brain works and how you can trick yourself in to doing the wrong things that I will be picking up a whole blog on this later. Definitely worth a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00M8PUC8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">read</a> or <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Organized-Mind-Audiobook/B00WIPXGEM">listen</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also enjoyed:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Homo-Deus-Audiobook/B01HGY2730">Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harai</a> - thinking about the world of tomorrow</li><li><a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Idiot-Brain-Audiobook/B01D0FOKXE">The Idiot Brain by Dean Burnett</a> - understanding how your brain so it doesn&#39;t completely own you</li><li><a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Diaries-1969-1979-Audiobook/B004EWYUCY">Diaries 1969-1979 by Michael Palin</a> - Pure relaxation as Michael Palin takes you through the early Monty Python days (the rest of the diaries are fantastic too)</li><li><a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Adolf-Hitler-Audiobook/B019FUCBCU">Adolf Hitler and my part in his downfall by Spike Milligan</a> - possibly more an English humour thing but the ability to keep yourself seeing the funny side in spite of horrific situations is very important to me</li></ul>

<p>And some podcasts (which I use Podbean on the iPhone for):</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.microsoftcloudshow.com/">Microsoft Cloudshow</a> - I love these two, just casually chatting about the latest Microsoft Cloud news, keeping you informed and entertained. Definitely my top pick</li><li><a href="https://intrazone.libsyn.com/">The Intrazone</a> - Chat and discussion directly from the SharePoint team and their good friends</li><li><a href="http://www.m365devpodcast.com/">Microsoft 365 Developer Podcast</a> - After a brief hiatus, Jeremy Thake has re-invigorated it brilliantly, bringing a heavy Microsoft Graph slant and great guests</li><li><a href="https://dotnetrocks.com/">.Net Rocks</a> - Really broad set of subjects that keeps me informed in the latest dev ideas</li><li><a href="https://thefutureorganization.com/future-work-podcast/">The Future of Work</a> - Moving away from the technical side, this gets you thinking about applying the technology not just using it for the sake of it - Jacob Morgan is a very interesting character with some great connections</li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr/episodes/downloads">Desert Island Disks</a> - a reminder about what is special in life</li></ul>

<h2>Retrospectives</h2>

<p>You cannot be productive without looking at how you haven&#39;t been productive. Look back once a month at what you have achieved and, more importantly, what you haven&#39;t been able to achieve will help you to understand yourself better. Looking inwards at what you have done and empathising with others so that you can understand why they may not have been able to work well with you will make sure that you always improve.</p>

<h2>Taking a break and enjoying the family</h2>

<p>I will finish off with the most important one, especially for those with partners and kids. Take time to enjoy them. Stop working, put down the phone and do some Hot Wheels, Scratch Jr or watch a dance class. Talking of which, I&#39;m off to help build a Hot Wheels timer with a Raspberry Pi and Scratch!</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-02T09:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have started using Azure Cosmos DB, you may have noticed that the backup story is pretty limited by default. Having recently deleted a test database by mistake and waited three days to get round the support maze to have it restored, it was a good chance to implement a more robust backup strategy.</p>

<p>The simplest way I have found to do this is to backup the entire DB using Azure Data Factory. Naturally it may depend on your DB size and you may want to instead backup the change feed on a more regular basis but this worked for well for our scenario.</p>

<p>To get started with Azure Data Factory:</p>

<ul><li>Add it as a service through the Azure Portal</li><li>Click on Author and Monitor to be taken to the home page</li><li>Click on Copy Data</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Azure Portal" src="/images/2018/12/AzurePortalDataFactory.PNG"/><img alt="Start SCreen" src="018/12/AzureDFStartScreen.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Fill out the name for your task</li><li>Add a Cosmos DB Linked Service as a source</li><li>Fill out the connection details</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Cosmos Linked Service" src="018/12/AzureDFCreateLinkedService.PNG"/><img alt="Cosmos Connection Details" src="ection.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Select the Cosmos collection (Items in the case below)</li><li>Select &quot;Export as-is to JSON files</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Cosmos Linked Service" src="/images/2018/12/AzureDFCosmosQuery.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Create a Destination Source</li><li>Use a new Azure Blob Storage linked service</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Linked Azure Blob Service" src="018/12/AzureDFCreateLinkedServiceStorage.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Define the file path and name, using a temporary name for now</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Linked Azure Blob Service File Path" src="018/12/AzureDFSelectFolder.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Click several Nexts until the wizard completes and creates the Pipeline</li><li>Click on the pencil icon an navigate through the Pipelines to find your newly created Copy Data Pipeline</li><li>Click on the Copy Data activity and navigate to the Sink section</li><li>Edit the Sink Dataset</li><li>Find the filepath, select backup.json and select Add Dynamic Content
<img alt="Azure Storage Filepath" src="/images/2018/12/AzureDFUpdateFolder.PNG"/></li><li>Change the value to &quot;@concat(utcnow(),&#39;.json&#39;)&quot; so that each run will give the file a unique name</li></ul>

<p>This completes it all so that you can now Debug to test it and then Publish when all ready. Depending on your preferences, you can create a Trigger to run this every day or to whatever frequency you need. To restore these backups, create a similar Copy Data task going back the other way.</p>

<p>Then sit back and feel better that you can do something stupid with delete in the portal without so much worry.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now make SharePoint look beautiful and the SharePoint Lookbook is a great starter to see how and share it in your organisation to break the stigma that surrounds SharePoint.</p>

<p>“SharePoint always looks rubbish”
“You have to spend lots of money to get SharePoint working on mobile”
“Never use the default navigation, it just won’t work”</p>

<p>All these are phrases I’ve heard and often said about SharePoint over the years but a lot of that is changing. The biggest recent example of this is the <a href="https://spdesign.azurewebsites.net/downloads/ignite-2018-lookbook.pdf">SharePoint Lookbook</a> – released at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2018/09/28/microsoft-ignite-2018-round-up-all-the-key-announcements-and-news/">Ignite 2018</a> and designed to focus on the designers out there and the way that they would go about designing sites. It breaks down the areas where you can make changes by adding headers and footers or select different webparts and the document gives great examples of the amazing looking sites that you can create. All of these are responsive so that they adapt well to working with mobile and tablet devices.</p>

<h2>No more starting projects with master templates</h2>

<p>The difference is that where you previously had to work on customising SharePoint heavily and focusing on those customisations at the start of the project, the content is now the king as you know that it will look great straight away. This is a bit of a swing from people who have long been trying to brand SharePoint exactly how they want things to look. Now the key is to get the content exactly how you want it to be, with images that meet your branding, with content written in a way that meets your organisations standards, with targeted items aimed at the right people, and with the apps that people use in their digital workplace day in day out.</p>

<p>So it becomes less about the customisation, the massive upfront effort to redesign your master pages and page templates and it becomes far more about getting the right content into your site and the imagery to continue your brand. That’s not to say that you can’t add elements of branding. You can create site designs which define what’s on your custom sites and you can specify logos and colours to blend SharePoint in to your own environment.</p>

<h2>More time for being productive</h2>

<p>The shift away from just doing the look and feel means that the project team can focus on people being productive. You can focus on people collaborating together. You can focus on the integration with Microsoft Teams, Planner, ToDo, Stream and the many other services available with Microsoft 365. That is where the importance is to employees and that is where the value organisations will get from SharePoint and Microsoft 365.</p>

<h2>Think about the team</h2>

<p>The SharePoint Lookbook is not just about the Communications Sites but also about Team Sites - sharing information and content between team members. The focus is on getting the right tasks to be done in front of people as simply as possible. Intelligent search will surface the right content to team members, allowing everyone to get started straight from their site.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Now you can spend your time working on getting people productive, you have more time to keep up to date with the changing world of SharePoint! In the mean time, you can see much of what will be arriving in Targeted Release tenants by the end of December in <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Build-your-modern-intranet-with-SharePoint-in-Office-365/ba-p/255453">this post on the Ignite 2018 round up</a> or listen to the <a href="https://intrazone.libsyn.com/bonus-roadmap-pitstop-november-2018">latest Intrazone podcast</a> where they discuss the changes. I will also be covering some of the changes as they hit my tenant so keep an eye on this blog.

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-04T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-framework">SharePoint PnP Provisioning framework</a> is great for creating sites from a template but sometimes you need to do that little bit more that PowerShell offers and one such scenario at the moment is setting the banner image for a page.</p>

<p>The full script for this can be found at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79SharePointScripts/blob/master/CreateTeamSiteWithCustomModernPage.ps1.</p>

<p>If you are connecting to multiple versions of SharePoint (e.g. SharePoint 2013, SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint Online), then I highly recommend <a href="https://www.erwinmcm.com/running-the-various-versions-of-pnp-powershell-side-by-side/">this post</a> from Erwin van Hunen.</p>

<h2>Getting started with the simple stuff</h2>

<p>The first step for almost all PnP PowerShell scripts is to run <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/connect-pnponline">Connect-PnPOnline</a>. My scripts generally take a credentials parameter at the start so that I do not need to keep entering credentials. You can also use -UseWebLogin, especially if you are using Multi-Factor Authentication.</p>

<p>Using PnP PowerShell, it is very easy to create a new Team or Communications Site using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/new-pnpsite">New-PnPSite</a>, passing the name and alias for the site (used for the Url).</p>

<p><code>
New-PnPSite -Type TeamSite -Title $departmentDisplayName -Alias $departmentName
</code></p>

<h2>Clearing the decks</h2>

<p>Making changes to existing pages is possible but as you do not know what could have been added to pages, I prefer to delete the existing page and add a brand new one. On the script example, the page has just been created so this may be overkill but as I tend to use these functions in other scripts, I kept it in.</p>

<p>Delete the current homepage with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/remove-pnpfile">Remove-PnPFile</a></p>

<p><code>
$removedFile = Remove-PnPFile -SiteRelativeUrl $homePageUrl -Force
</code></p>

<p>and add a new blank one with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/add-pnpclientsidepage">Add-PnPClientSidePage</a></p>

<p><code>
$newHomepage = Add-PnPClientSidePage -Name &quot;Home&quot; -LayoutType Article
</code></p>

<p>and then in the interests of clearing the deck, remove all sections on the page too</p>

<p><code>
$homepage = Get-PnPClientSidePage -Identity Home
$homepage.Sections.Clear()
</code></p>

<h2>Adding some basic content</h2>

<p>The simplest content to add is the the latest content on the site with a Content Rollup web part based on the left section.</p>

<p><code>
Add-PnPClientSidePageSection -Page Home -SectionTemplate TwoColumnLeft
Add-PnPClientSideWebPart -Page Home -DefaultWebPartType ContentRollup -Section 1 -Column 1
</code></p>

<p>The page can then be saved and set as the home page using the WelcomePage of the RootFolder</p>

<p><code>
$ctx = Get-PnPContext
$web = Get-PnPWeb
$ctx.Load($web.RootFolder)
**$web.RootFolder.WelcomePage = &quot;sitepages/Home.aspx&quot;**
$web.RootFolder.Update()
$ctx.ExecuteQuery()
</code></p>

<h2>Finally the complex bit</h2>

<p>This took quite a bit of testing and searching on how to set this and I hope to try and integrate this in to a <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell">PnP PowerShell</a> pull request.</p>

<p>The first step is to get the ID of the image you want to set as the banner. The image should already be uploaded to SharePoint somewhere although you can reference an external URL as well - I would recommend not doing this though as you are reliant on the image remaining there and adding external calls.</p>

<p><code>
$stockImageUrl = $tenantSitesUrl + $stockImageSite
Connect-PnPOnline $stockImageUrl -Credentials $mycreds
$bannerImageItem = Get-PnPFile -Url $bannerImageLink -AsListItem
$bannerImageId = $bannerImageItem[&quot;UniqueId&quot;]
</code></p>

<p>Adding the webpart html is key. To split out the right content, converting it to xml first to make it easier to set the right parameters. The unique ID of the image retrieved in the first section as well as the image URL are set in the HTML and then set back on the page. You can also set the focal point location by changing the translate X and translate Y settings but I found that doing this on the page and then copying the values was the easiest way.</p>

<p><code></code>`
$page = Get-PnPClientSidePage $pageName
$layoutWebPartsText = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-sp-canvascontrol=&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; data-sp-canvasdataversion=&quot;&quot;1.2&quot;&quot; data-sp-controldata=&quot;&quot;&amp;#123;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;cbe7b0a9-3504-44dd-a3a3-0e5cacd07788&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;instanceId&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;cbe7b0a9-3504-44dd-a3a3-0e5cacd07788&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;Title Region&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;Title Region Description&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serverProcessedContent&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;quot;htmlStrings&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;#125;,&amp;quot;searchablePlainTexts&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;#125;,&amp;quot;imageSources&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;#125;,&amp;quot;links&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;,&amp;quot;dataVersion&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;1.2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;properties&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;#123;&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&amp;#58;&amp;quot;Home&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;imageSourceType&amp;quot;&amp;#58;4,&amp;quot;translateX&amp;quot;&amp;#58;49.2,&amp;quot;translateY&amp;quot;&amp;#58;74.3&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>$layoutWebPartsXml = New-Object -TypeName XML
$layoutWebPartsXml.LoadXml($layoutWebPartsText)
$controlDataText = $layoutWebPartsXml.ChildNodes[0].ChildNodes[0].Attributes[&quot;data-sp-controldata&quot;]
$controlData = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $controlDataText.&#39;#text&#39;
$controlData.serverProcessedContent.imageSources | Add-Member imageSource $bannerImageLink -Force
$controlData.properties | Add-Member uniqueId $bannerImageId -Force
$controlData.properties | Add-Member imageSourceType 2 -Force
$controlDataTextUpdated = ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $controlData
$layoutWebPartsXml.ChildNodes[0].ChildNodes[0].Attributes[&quot;data-sp-controldata&quot;].Value = $controlDataTextUpdated
$page.PageListItem[&quot;LayoutWebpartsContent&quot;] = $layoutWebPartsXml.OuterXml
$page.PageListItem.Update()
$ctx = Get-PnPContext
$ctx.Load($page.PageListItem)
$ctx.ExecuteQuery()
<code></code>`</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The script allows you to build out sites using PowerShell scripts which can either be run manually or built in to an Azure Function and run on a trigger. PnP Provisioning is great for building out the structure of sites and can be used for pages but there are still cases where PowerShell can be more suitable.</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-05T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The modern SharePoint webparts have added connectors to Twitter, Facebook pages, YouTube and many others but there are still some gaps like Instagram - here is how you can use Microsoft Flow to push your content in to SharePoint.</p>

<p><img alt="Instagram feed on SharePoint" src="018/12/InstagramToSharePoint.PNG"/></p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p><a href="https://emea.flow.microsoft.com">Microsoft Flow</a> is an easy to use tool that runs workflows that can be triggered from a large number of systems. Many of the connectors included are Social Media connectors such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>With the Instagram trigger, a Flow can be started whenever a new photo is uploaded to your account. The connector returns a link to the image which can be pulled using the HTTP activity. The contents can then be written to a SharePoint library.</p>

<p><img alt="Instagram to SharePoint Flow" src="nstagramToSharePointFlow.PNG"/></p>

<p>Ignore the error message in the image which was due to me hiding the site used.</p>

<h2>Showing the contents</h2>

<p>As you can see in the top image, the document library can be displayed as an image gallery on any page with a set of tiles for the images.</p>

<p>Should you need to customise the display further, you could also a <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerApp</a> to retrieve the feed and render the results as you want with details like the caption and other text.</p>

<p>You can also custom develop a webpart using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview">SharePoint Framework</a> and deploy across your organisation, allowing full control to the HTML returned.</p>

<h2>Is this needed for all social networks?</h2>

<p>Thankfully Microsoft has already created many of the connectors as webparts that can be used without any customisation. The example of the Twitter feed is shown above and below are the current set of webparts available in first release tenants.</p>

<p><a href="018/12/ListOfWebParts.PNG">List of WebParts</a>
<a href="/images/2018/12/ListOfWebParts2.PNG">List of WebParts with connectors</a></p>

<h2>A brief warning</h2>

<p>The HTTP connector is due to move to require a P1 or P2 license for Flow so there will be additional cost for the licenses. However, if you are already using the HTTP connector, you have an extension as the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-Retirement-Blog/Updates-to-Microsoft-Flow-and-PowerApps-for-Office-365/ba-p/289589">detailed post</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Customers with active users of these features will get an automatic extension until January 31, 2020 or the expiration of their existing Office 365 subscription term (whichever is longer).</p></blockquote>

<h2>Is it easy to create the flow?</h2>

<p>Yes, it doesn&#39;t take long to copy the flow but you can also import the Flow directly using this <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79SharePointScripts/blob/master/UploadInstagramFeedtoSharePoint.zip">Exported Flow</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-06T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All software development should be agile and code delivered through CI/CD. A bold statement but one thought by many people. Agile gives the engagement between all involved stakeholders from the developers through to the user and helps everyone understand what is wanted. CI/CD helps to ensure that you can make small changes with next to zero breakages or impact - note that I did say helps and not just ensures there. These simplifications of the full reality are generally accepted by teams but for mid to large organisations there is a bigger question - how do you budget for an agile project?</p>

<h2>How does budgeting usually work?</h2>

<p>From experience, many organisations have a run the business pot and a change the business pot. The run side caters for keeping the organisation running with support teams and server costs for existing applications sitting there. For new projects, enhancements and new ideas, the budget comes from the change the business side. Apologies to any finance folks out there that I have over simplified the notion.</p>

<p>Many of the issues with budgeting comes as mid level managers have to make decisions about what is essential and work out how to expand what is considered to be run so that they can fit in projects considered to be important. Nice to have projects are then fought over in the change the business pots.</p>

<p><img alt="Coins" src="018/12/coins.jpg"/></p>

<h2>How are agile projects any different?</h2>

<p>In some ways they are not. As long as you consider them run the business projects and accept that a certain level of enhancement to continue the application being effective is key. The problems crop up when user groups decide during the year (as budgets are generally run annually) that something larger needs to change. This could be because of a business opportunity, a regulatory change or just the whim of a senior director.</p>

<p>Agile projects are generally open ended with user stories gathered constantly and prioritised. The notion of a project with a defined end point disappears as you continuously enhance your product, adapting to change as you go along. At the start of each sprint, you look at the resources you have, compare with the stories in the backlog and get cracking.</p>

<h2>A new way</h2>

<p>The key to budgeting in an agile world is to have agile budgeting. Bring the review periods for budgets to smaller increments. Have sprint style committees to discuss the upcoming roadmaps and use planning poker for teams to be able to re-allocate budgets. Teams often hold budget for longer for fear of losing it so remove that fear and allow the flow between different areas more dynamically.</p>

<p>Retrospectives offer the perfect oppurtunity to see if budget is well spent and to steer future spend. Review the cost per sprint velocity and whether this is dropping. This is also a change to review hardware and cloud spend, allowing devs the opportunity to see the impact of their architectural decisions. With cloud computing, it becomes more instant to see the cost reduction of better performing code.</p>

<h2>Sounds like utopia but will it actually happen?</h2>

<p>If the willingness to change is not there then it certainly won&#39;t. This reckons more realistic discussions and more openness, something that can be lacking from large organisations. It puts more exposure but over funded areas that are not performing but also puts more pressure on constantly justifying work done. This may lead to more stress for teams but the aim should be to make rational discussions part of the new normal, reducing the constant stress of it.</p>

<p>Metrics will show that less money is wasted this way so the will should be there. Large enterprises are like juggernauts so it won&#39;t change quickly but more organisations like ING are adopting agile and so will be adopting more techniques like this. Time will tell.</p>]]></content>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[An Advent series - Are you learning the right way?]]></title>
        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-07T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you learn new things? Do you organise a course and spend a long day in front of a blackboard? Do you prefer to get a book and read to learn or spend your commute listening to audiobooks and podcasts? Or do you prefer to delve in to new ideas yourself and explore through doing?</p>

<p>In Daniel Levitin&#39;s great book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information-ebook/dp/B00M8PUC8K">The Organised Mind</a>, he talks about three types of learning:</p>

<ul><li>Explicit learning - the most well known type where you actively try and learn, such as at school</li><li>Implicit learning - being exposed to something such as a language while in a foreigh country</li><li>Learning through self-discovery</li></ul>

<p>Daniel notes that recent studies have suggested learning through self discovery helps you to learn better and for longer than the more traditional ways. In practice, this means exploring ideas, thinking through theories yourself and not just accepting the way things are.</p>

<h2>Is this the end of books and courses then?</h2>

<p><img alt="Books" src=""/></p>

<p>My first thought is that if it is working for you then don&#39;t change things. For many people, explicit learning works well and in certain circumstances, it fits much better. In 1991, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1834770">this study</a> found that there was a wider range of results for explicit learning compared with implicit but that those with a higher IQ tended to perform better in explicit.</p>

<p>There is also the benefit that sitting in a training course offers to allowing you to consider the topic during the quiet times. Apologies to any Trainers reading this but daydreaming has been shown to allow the brain to process knowledge and let it sink in more effectively. I find courses trigger considerations not just on the topic but how it can be applied as well. They are also the most cost effective way to introduce groups of people to a topic in one go.</p>

<h2>So should I sit on my laptop each night and try things out?</h2>

<p>Short answer - yes.</p>

<p>Many people (if not most) reading this blog will work in technology in one form or other. You can attend courses but in many organisations, these are hard to arrange and negotiate time out of the office. Exploring technology in your own time is the way to get hands-on experience with new ideas and theories. I would still not have found the pleasure of developing in the SharePoint Framework or realised how helpful that the PnP patterns can be. You shouldn&#39;t shun your family or cats while doing it but make the most of your time to understand outside your day to day.</p>

<p>This can be supplemented with implicit learning by joining user groups and attending conferences. Being immersed in new ideas that you try out and explore further establishes better engagement with the topics and builds contacts to help you along the way as well.</p>

<h2>Finding time</h2>

<p>The challenge with these are finding the time to think. Find a quiet time with either no music or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZeKCadgRdKQ">focused music</a> and allow the thoughts to flow. Back to Daniel Levitin&#39;s book and a study by Angeline Lillard and Jennifer Peterson of the University of Virginia studied the difference in four year olds watching the fast paced Spongebob Squarepants vs the the slower Caillou. The fast moving Spongebob had impacts on the children&#39;s executive function, causing problems with attention, working memory and problem solving. The slower show allowed the children to build pathways in their brain and think through the ideas to completion.</p>

<p>So to learn better and perform better, it&#39;s time to be less SpongeBob and more Caillou.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-08T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I promised this blog a couple of months back and after a <a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie/status/1072024346825244672">tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie">Gregor Suttie</a> asking about what people were using if not Wordpress, it seems a good time to write this.</p>

<h2>The journey to Jekyll</h2>

<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.mcd79.com/2017/03/02/hosting-a-ghost-publishing-blog-on-aws-using-a-custom-office-ui-fabric-theme-2.html">blog previously</a> on using the <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/?_ga=2.17361915.390977825.1544461432-1817619238.1544461432">Ghost blog engine</a> on AWS as that is how I had hosted my blog. After my trial year on AWS finished, the costs started creeping up so I flipped over to Google Cloud Engine. Sadly, despite good initial impressions, the free level VM just wasn&#39;t enough to run Ghost well and I had quite a few complaints of things not loading. I tried running Ghost on Google App Engine but it was more expensive for the same level of experience.</p>

<p>I had always wanted to run my blog on Azure as that&#39;s where I do most of my work but had not found enough options to do that cheaply. That was until the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-storage-static-web-hosting-public-preview/">Azure Blob Static Website preview</a> hit and when coupled with <a href="http://www.microsoftcloudshow.com/">Microsoft Cloud Show</a> mentioning Jekyll, the stars had aligned.</p>

<h2>What is Jekyll?</h2>

<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a lightweight engine that allows you to write your blog in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> and then build out your blog as static pages. This makes them lightening fast to load and easy to host as you just need static storage. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">getting started guide</a> is simple and you don&#39;t need to know any Ruby to get going.</p>

<p>There are two main pain points:</p>

<ul><li>You need to compile your posts to deploy them each time</li><li>There aren&#39;t so many templates</li></ul>

<p>However, if you are a bit of a developer, the first point is simple as you can build a CI/CD process and simply check-in your posts to trigger an update - more on this later.</p>

<p>For the template, I had purchased a Ghost template to add a better look than my Delve inspired one previously so I adapted this to work with Jekyll. This was the most complex and onerous step as there were no guides I could find to adapt the syntax directly but running Jekyll locally, it was just a case of iterating through across a couple of evenings. You can also start with one of the base templates and implement your own with basic CSS knowledge too.</p>

<h2>Migrating content</h2>

<p>One other concern I had was migrating all the content but you could easily extract from Ghost as a large JSON file. There are importers written for most of the main blogging engines such as <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpress/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/ghost/">Ghost</a> listed and this ran quickly and without any issues.</p>

<p>There was some manual formatting needed through some pages although nothing four or five bulk find and replaces couldn&#39;t solve. The biggest manual pain was the image assets as some of my earlier posts appear to lose the context but I did not have enough posts for this to be a large problem.</p>

<h2>Creating a static website in Azure Storage</h2>

<p>Creating a very simple website is not very easy when you create a new Blob Storage account. Under the left menu, there is now a Static Website Preview link. Enabling this, creates a container called $web where you can then upload your static content.</p>

<p><img alt="Static Website Preview" src="e.PNG"/></p>

<p>Upload an index.html with basic content and you will be able to access the page at the link described on the static website screen, e.g. https://blabla.z6.web.core.windows.net.</p>

<h2>Deploying posts</h2>

<p>On to the fun part! Running the command:</p>

<p><code>bundle exec jekyll build</code></p>

<p>creates the blog in the _site folder. You can then upload these files to the Azure Blob Storage in the $web container and ask your blog with that link. If that is all you are looking for, then you are good to go.</p>

<h2>Using custom domain names</h2>

<p>A great step with the static website is that you can now use custom domain names and also with https.</p>

<p>There are some details on this mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website">Microsoft Docs</a> around static websites but I found myself getting lost in circles around the set-up. So here are my steps:</p>

<ul><li>Create a new Azure CDN</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Azure CDN Create" src="018/12/AzureCDNCreate.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Configure the CDN Profile choosing whichever CDN you like - I chose the Microsoft one for the pricing</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Azure CDN Profile" src="/images/2018/12/AzureCDNProfile.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Once created, add an Endpoint to the CDN with the following properties</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Azure CDN Endpoint" src="018/12/AzureCDNEndpoint.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>It may take a little time but you should now be able to access your blog via https://mcd79blogdemo.azureedge.net</li><li>Select custom domain from the left menu</li><li>In another window, use your domain registrat to set up as per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-custom-ssl?tabs=option-1-default-enable-https-with-a-cdn-managed-certificate#custom-domain-is-mapped-to-your-cdn-endpoint-by-a-cname-record">this link</a> - below is my example from GoDaddy</li></ul>

<p><img alt="GoDaddy www config" src="oDaddyCDN1.PNG"/>
<img alt="GoDaddy CDNVerify" src="oDaddyCDN2.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Add a Custom Domain in the Azure Portal with the CDN endpoint URL and your custom domain</li><li>Select the Custom Domain and enable HTTPS as below</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Azure CDN Custom Domain" src="ustomDomain.PNG"/></p>

<p>It may take a little time for the domain to be validated and the certificate correctly provisioned but after a couple of hours, you should be able to access your blog via the custom domain name.</p>

<h2>Deploying with Azure Dev Ops</h2>

<p>The steps to build and deploy are relatively simple if a little slow to run due to the requirement to set up Ruby and the Ruby Gems for Jekyll. The first step is to check-in your code to either Git in your Azure Repo or to Github. Then you need a new build pipeline.</p>

<ul><li>Connect to the repo you have created</li><li>Select an empty template</li><li>Add the &quot;Use Ruby Version&quot; task and configure for version spec &quot;&gt;= 2.4&quot;</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Ruby Task" src="ldRubyTask.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Add a command line task to install jekyll bundler using <code>gem install jekyll bundler</code></li><li>Add a command line task to install any custom gems using <code>bundle install</code></li><li>Add a command line task to build the blog using <code>bundle exec jekyll build</code></li><li>Create a Copy Files task to put the _Site directory to a staging area</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Copy Files task" src="evOpsCopyFiles.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>Add a Publish Artifact task to publish the _site directory</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Publish Artifact" src="evOpsPublishArtifact.PNG"/></p>

<p>I have this build set to Continuous Integration so that it builds on every check-in but it could also be manually triggered.</p>

<p>Next create a new release pipeline with an empty template:</p>

<ul><li>Add the defined build as an artifact</li><li>Add an Azure CLI task with the command <code>az storage blob upload-batch --source _site --destination $(containerName) --account-name $(storageAccount) --output table --no-progress</code></li></ul>

<p><img alt="Dev Ops Release Task" src="018/12/DevOpsReleaseTask.PNG"/></p>

<ul><li>You will notice two variables which need to be added to define the storageAccount and containerName (which should be $web)</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Dev Ops Variables" src="/images/2018/12/DevOpsVariables.PNG"/></p>

<p>Again, you can set this up to release automatically with the build completing but in my case, I decided to allow this to happen manually to control when it took place. The main reason for this is at this stage I do not have an automated way for the CDN to be purged to get the latest home page showing the updated blog posts but I would like to build this in with a script later.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As you are reading this, you know that a Jekyll based blog hosted in Azure static website can work. I see this as a great option for blogs and other static websites for more technical writers and at a much lower price than many other blog engines that need https and a custom domain.

        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-09T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you used <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell">PnP PowerShell</a> or many of the other great community initiatives under the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/community/community">SharePoint PnP banner</a>? Have you ever hit an issue with it? What did you do? Raise an issue? Tweet one of the community? Did you consider trying to fix it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my little story of making a fix to an issue I found. The <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/issues/1051">issue</a> was that I was trying to copy files that had ampersands in the name. These were supported in SharePoint Online and OneDrive but I was hitting an error when copying using Copy-PnpFile between site collections - strangely, this didn&#39;t occur when in the same site collection.</p>

<p>The first step to try and fix the issue was to get the source code running - the details for this can be found at the bottom of the <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell">PnP PowerShell Github</a> page. You can then follow along with the details <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing</a> page.</p>

<p>In the issue I encountered, it was more complex as the issue could either been considered in the core PnP or in PnP PowerShell. I decided that it made more sense to make the change in PnP PowerShell, as I noted in the issue description:</p>

<blockquote><p>So why haven&#39;t I logged this in Core? Well I think that this logic may need to move back in to PowerShell and cater for different platforms as the characters above are still relevant for 2013. Therefore I think that the Upload File should be brought in to the CopyFile.cs class and use different Regex expressions for the different platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I had fixed the issue and tested it but using this version in my migration scripts, I added some unit tests and created a pull request. At this point, I started a discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/erwinvanhunen">Erwin Van Hunen</a> aka the Godfather of PnP Powershell. The reason was that the tests needed two site collections but this broke the fundemental assumption of needing a single site collection.</p>

<p>As with many people running open source projects, any complication can cause changes to take longer to get sorted. As I had a fix for my situation, I didn&#39;t chase as much as I could have so it sat as an open pull request for some time. What I loved though was that it was left open and robbert-vanandel commented on the Pull Request. This was a spur for Erwin to agree to some changes on the additional site collection and there was my first accepted Pull Request.</p>

<p>It was a relatively simple change but I hope the first of more changes to make. Just need to find more energy to pick up some more!</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2018-12-10T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who has been working in technology and development since the early 2000s, there is always a risk of becoming jaded and just seeing new technologies as the same old thing. But there are still things I get excited about. One of those was the advent of the Modern SharePoint push that started with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2016/05/04/the-future-of-sharepoint/">Future of SharePoint event</a> in May 2016, showing that Microsoft could work in a responsive way and make good looking sites with little effort.</p>

<p>There was still a lot of work to do to make sure that all the features of class SharePoint pages could be met and I believe that almost everything can now be done (with the exception of full branding and in my opinion that is a good thing). The problem now is that while migrating between SharePoint versions is not needed, there is still a big step to migrate pages to the new version. Until now, this required a lot of manual work, blood, sweat and tears to take the old pages and copy the content to new pages. Not any longer.</p>

<h2>Modernize your SharePoint pages</h2>

<p><img alt="Create Modern Version" src="/images/2018/12/createmodernversion.png"/></p>

<p>With yet another example of the power of the SharePoint Community, the PnP Core team has got together has worked to create a tool that can automatically migrate a classic webpart page in SharePoint over to a modern page. They have created a set of libraries that can be used to:</p>

<ul><li>Automate the migration of pages using either PowerShell or .Net</li><li>Allow users to migrate page by page using the SharePoint UI</li></ul>

<p>The second part there is the amazing part where you can allow site owners to take control and move across the content as they want to. This is so key to help migrations work as site owners are the people who know how they want their sites to work but are often busy people with a bigger focus on their main business, not on updating SharePoint. This puts the power in their hands. They can view a preview and choose whether to proceed or role back.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that IT Pros and Developers are left out as the migrations can be scripted and run automatically as well. Whether you are more comfortable in C# or PowerShell, the options are there.</p>

<p>You can read more about modernizing SharePoint pages at:</p>

<p>https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/modernize-your-sharepoint-pages/</p>

<p>And you can view an example by <a href="https://twitter.com/O365Bert">Bert Jansen</a> from the SharePoint Dev Community Monthly Call:</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-11T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="/tag/bots">talked about using the Bot Framework to create Bots on my blog</a> previously and think it&#39;s a great solution for creating code that works across multiple channels with minimal extra effort. Microsoft has continued to build on its platform by looking at the earlier complexities while retaining the ability to work across the channels.</p>

<p>V4 was made <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates/microsoft-bot-framework-v4-sdk-is-now-generally-available/">generally available</a> in September 2018 and it has been a major difference to V3. <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudguy_pro">Stefan Bisser</a> has a great slide showing a breakdown of the elements the build up the Bot Framework. The patterns and concepts layer is where the big changes are, improving the ability to modularise the dialogs (i.e. groups of conversations) and middleware such as connections to <a href="https://www.luis.ai">Language Understanding service (LUIS)</a> and other Azure Services.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Framework V4 breakdown" src="/images/2018/12/BotFrameworkV4.jpg"/></p>

<p>If you have used earlier versions, you will find v4 a big leap and a very different way of working. The focus on Dialogs has shifted and the use of DialogContainers has made it simpler to group expected conversations together. The use of State has been simplified and more samples for saving state using Azure Storage and Cosmos DB made more prominent.</p>

<p>One thing I found very interesting was the ability to create a Dispatch to wrap around multiple instances of <a href="https://www.luis.ai">LUIS</a> and the <a href="https://www.qnamaker.ai/">QnAMaker</a> that will route to the appropriate service based on the responses received. This reduces the amount of custom code and helps simplify how it appears there, something I have found a struggle in the past. The downside is that setting up the Dispatch is too complex with slightly random command lines needed to be run to merge Luis intents with the QnAMaker. The idea is solid but there is more that can be done with the implementation.</p>

<p>If you are looking to get started with a brand new bot, the Bot Framework Blog has a great post:</p>

<p>https://blog.botframework.com/2018/05/07/build-a-microsoft-bot-framework-bot-with-the-bot-builder-sdk-v4/</p>

<p>And there are some very useful samples around Bot-Builder:
https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples</p>

<p>Sadly, I have not found much in the way of guidance on migrating Bots to V4 and my experience so far has been to review what your Bot is doing and re-write it, rather than update in place. The ways of constructing your Bot can gain so many benefits in the new format that it is worth the pain.</p>

<p>Finally, a shout out to the <a href="https://github.com/botbuildercommunity">Bot Builder Community</a> for all the work they are doing and making available to fill in some of the gaps in the Bot Framework.</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-12T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After recently writing about ways to learn, today I went along to one of those ways with the UK Tech Communities Hackathon on Bots and AI. This was a chance to hear from some experts on AI and the Bot Framework in the morning and then work in groups of people who haven&#39;t met before to try and meet a challenge.</p>

<h2>What did we learn?</h2>

<p>The presentations in the morning covered a range of topics but started with a very interesting talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/mrobson1975">Michael Robson</a> on Ethics in AI, reminding us that it is our responsibility as developers and technology implementers to ensure that we consider the impacts of the solutions we create. It is right that Microsoft is putting so much focus on this and pushing to developers to keep thinking, not just mindlessly pushing ahead. This may not guarantee that Terminator doesn&#39;t come true but it helps to do what we can to avoid it.</p>

<p>Experts like <a href="https://twitter.com/SPDoctor">Bill Ayers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GosiaBorzecka">Gosia Borzecka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkStokes">Mark Stokes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudguy_pro">Stephan Bisser</a> spoke on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/">Cognitive Services</a> and the <a href="https://dev.botframework.com/">Bot Framework</a>, keeping us all engaged at the Microsoft Reactor in London. Then, they introduced us to the challenge for the hackathon itself.</p>

<h2>Learning by doing</h2>

<p>The challenge was to create a Bot from scratch using the Bot Framework to pull information from an FAQ to act as a IT helper. Ultimately, all the teams were able to get something working with a range of people from developers to power users and systems analysts.</p>

<p><img alt="HelpMe365Bot" src="/images/2018/12/HelpMe365Bot.PNG"/></p>

<p>However, the point I am hoping to make here is that all of us learnt from the event by getting hands on. Whether it was the technical detail of using Dispatches in the Bot Framework, how to pull FAQs from a SharePoint list to a Bot or the benefits of using the Language Understanding service to understand intents and entities from natural language.</p>

<p>I came back home energised by others and bubbling with ideas on how I could use my new understanding. Many of the Bots shown were tailored to be for the attendees organisations or clients so people were already applying their thoughts in to reality. Microsoft had advocates and specialists to answer questions and engage with us all, meaning it was not just a case of learning at the pace of a presentation but learning at our own pace too. We learnt from each other, realising what was harder for others to take onboard and what needed more explanation.</p>

<p>If you are interested in trying out a hackathon, sign up for the <a href="https://uk.communities.tech">UK Tech Communities</a> mailing list and get along to their next events or keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/reactor/">Microsoft Reactor London site</a> if you are in the UK.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2018-12-13T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted an easy way to show off how good Modern SharePoint looks for an Intranet? The PnP Community have a great solution for you.</p>

<p>Modern Sites in SharePoint work fantastically out of the box and it is very quick and easy to get a great looking site. What the Starter Kit offers on top is to demonstrate how to add additional customisations to the site with items like a custom footer and additional webparts. It demonstrates how you can integrate custom changes that maintain the same look and feel to the rest of the modern site.</p>

<h2>How do you set it up?</h2>

<p>One of the real benefits of this kit is the demonstration of creating a set of sites and supporting metadata which is set up with a single command. The installation of the starter kit makes use of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/apply-pnptenanttemplate?view=sharepoint-ps">tenant template</a> scripts from the PnP community meaning that a single line can be used to build up multiple site collections:</p>

<p><code>Apply-PnPTenantTemplate -Path starterkit.pnp -Parameters @{&quot;SiteUrlPrefix&quot;=&quot;demo&quot;}</code></p>

<p>A couple of things I found while using the scripts:</p>

<ul><li>You need to be the TermStore admin which isn&#39;t set by default in a new tenant - https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/issues/196</li><li>At the moment, it doesn&#39;t appear to work when you have MFA enabled but hopefully someone out there will be able to solve this soon - https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/issues/179</li></ul>

<h2>What do you get?</h2>

<p><img alt="Contoso Portal" src="/images/2018/12/ContosoElectronics.PNG"/></p>

<p>The script will add a set of Site Designs and Site Scripts which can be used to create department team sites and others, a set of webparts such as the world clocks, people directory and tiles and finally some page customisations such as the portal footer. It is a great example of building on the standard sites that can be used without breaking the look and feel. It demonstrates how you can keep it SharePoint-y while retaining a corporate brand.</p>

<p>What is great to see is how the list of web parts are expanding and it is good opportunity to start contributing yourself. Don&#39;t forget...</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>

        <updated>2018-12-14T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modern SharePoint sites are taking hold and so people are starting to make real use of them, including the latest changes like Page Approvals.</p>

<p>I have worked on a few different Intranet/Digital Workplace projects now and in almost all of them, there has been the requirement to have a Policies site. Whether it was for the HR policies only or included all policies for the whole organisation, it needed to make it easy for staff to find the latest changes and not be hidden away. In many cases, there was also the requirement to have approvals for any changes to a policy. So how could this look on a Modern SharePoint site?</p>

<p><img alt="Modern SharePoint Policies Site" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointPoliciesSite.PNG"/></p>

<p>I had a few requirements:</p>

<ul><li>It should be able to cope with Policies as documents and as pages</li><li>There should be an approval process for changes to policies</li><li>Policies should have metadata, initially Department and Role that the policy is relevant for</li><li>You should be able to see the latest policy changes</li><li>It should work on mobile devices</li></ul>

<p>I started out with a standard Communications Site and then took a look to see which policies I could use. Thanks to the wonderful sharing nature of the internet, I have added the following:</p>

<ul><li>Project Management Policy - https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/Project<em>Management</em>Risk_Management.pdf</li><li>IT Architecture Policies - https://ict.police.uk/national-strategic-ict-principles/</li><li>Sales and Marketing Policy - https://www.infogovbasics.com/challenges/sales-marketing-customer-expereince/</li><li>Security Policy - https://www.projectmanagementdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Security-Policy.docx</li><li>Company Handbook - http://www.human-resource-solutions.co.uk/HR-Policy-Pages/HR-Policy-Manual/Document<em>Management</em>HR<em>Policy</em>Manual.html</li></ul>

<p>Some of these I copied out in to pages and others I left as documents which were then displayed on a page using a File Viewer WebPart.</p>

<p><img alt="Company Handbook" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointCompanyHandbook.PNG"/>
<img alt="Sales Governance" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointSalesGovernance.PNG"/></p>

<p>For the list of policies, they are displayed as tiles in a list and grouped by the metadata such as by role. The content can be searched using the standard site search box and users can create their own views if required.</p>

<p><img alt="Policies by role" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointPoliciesByRole.PNG"/></p>

<p>The latest changes are shown as tiles on the home page so staff can easily see the latest.</p>

<p><img alt="Policies by role" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointLatestChanges.PNG"/></p>

<p>Finally, you can show these policies on other sites, such as the Human Resources site. Eagle eyed readers may notice that this is from the SharePoint Starter Kit - more on that in a minute.</p>

<p><img alt="Policies on HR site" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointCrossSitePolicies.PNG"/></p>

<p>So is this all that is needed?</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The lack of search box on the main part of the screen and the inability to show the policy metadata on the tiles reduces some of the benefits of the improved looks. It is also not possible to show a policy in multiple departments or roles in this way, even though it can be possible to mark a policy with multiple values.</p>

<p>What is better news is that all this can be changed. You can develop a custom webpart to show the policies in a single view that can be sliced and diced by the metadata and a search box added. This is something I will cover in a future blog post.</p>

<p>I would also like to submit this to the SharePoint Starter Kit but before I do, I would love to get some feedback as to the sort of extra requirements you have seen or requested before. Drop me a tweet with any thoughts.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modern SharePoint Page Approvals have really added to the possibilities of modern pages for real life situations, especially where teams want to control the content that is displayed to all. With classic pages, you could use the default publishing or use the clunky SharePoint Designer Workflows but now the Flow backed approvals are far easier.</p>

<h2>Setting up page approvals</h2>

<p>To set up an approval process on your Pages library, you navigate to that library and expand the Flow menu.</p>

<p><img alt="Setting up page approval" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointSetupPageApproval.PNG"/></p>

<p>You can then configure the name of the flow and who the approvers should be. Expanding details shows the connections that are either used or set up if they do not already exist.</p>

<p><img alt="Configure Flow" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointConfigureFlow.PNG"/></p>

<p>You now have a flow set up. Any amendments you make to a page now show the option to Submit For Approval instead of just saving.</p>

<p><img alt="Configure Flow" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointSubmitForApproval.PNG"/></p>

<p>Once clicked, you must enter some approval comments and then wait for the approver to get moving. If you happen to be the approver, you can approve the page straightaway by clicking on Review Approvals and reviewing the approval.</p>

<p><img alt="Configure Flow" src="/images/2018/12/ModernSharePointApproveEdit.PNG"/></p>

<p>If you have the Flow App on your phone, you get a notification that you can approve there and then. If you have an Apple Watch, you get even more interupted!</p>

<p><img alt="Configure Flow" src="/images/2018/12/FlowApproval.PNG"/></p>

<p>The approver can reassign or add comments before approving or rejecting. It&#39;s as simple as that. But what if you don&#39;t want it to be as simple as that?</p>

<h2>Customising the Flow</h2>

<p>What about if you wanted two levels of approval? Or what if there are different approvals depending on the department selected? The great news is that you can configure the Flow once it is created. Navigate to https://flow.microsoft.com and you will find the Flow that you created under My Flows.</p>

<p><img alt="My Flows" src="018/12/MyFlows.PNG"/></p>

<p>Editting the Flow, you can add a condition to send an approval based on the Relevant Department.</p>

<p><img alt="Flow condition" src="/images/2018/12/FlowCondition.PNG"/></p>

<p>This means that you can extend the logic or change the details as needed.</p>

<p>With all these in place, we have met all the requirements I spoke about in the previous post. Next, it&#39;s time to look at some customisations.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much of the focus on modern SharePoint has been on the pages and lists but for me, the true magic has been the introduction of modern development tooling with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview">SharePoint Framework</a> (SPFX) that has introduced tools like <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> to deliver powerful front-end solutions. When coupled with the great community of developers like the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/community/community">PnP community</a> that deliver <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/SharePoint/gallery/?filterBy=SharePoint,Samples">samples</a> and other tools (like <a href="https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs">PnP JS</a>), it is much easier to develop modern looking solutions that match the new look. To demonstrate this, I have extended the Policies pages from my <a href="/2018/12/15/advent-day-fifteen-adding-page-approvals-in-modern-site.html">last</a> <a href="/2018/12/14/advent-day-fourteen-building-policies-site-in-modern-site.html">posts</a> to have a webpart that allows you to search by the tagged metadata for each of the documents. You can see the full solution at https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79PoliciesViewer.</p>

<p><img alt="Policies Viewer" src="/images/2018/12/PolicesViewerWebPart.PNG"/></p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>There are some great documents from Microsoft around getting started with SPFX at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant so I won&#39;t replicate too much of that. I picked the webpart and went for React as the Framework. So instead the focus of this is what I used to show the documents. I wanted it to look like SharePoint so I used <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric">Office UI Fabric</a> to integrate it well. To retrieve the data, I used the PnP JS Core framework.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>The webpart retrieves the list of policies from SitePages on the site. It also expects two lists - Departments and PolicyRoles. These provide the metadata that can be assigned to policies and can also be searched for.</p>

<p>PnP JS gives a good looking bit of code for querying lists, such as the code below for retrieving the departments:</p>

<pre><code>public getRoles(): Promise&lt;any[]&gt; {
    return pnp.sp.web
    .lists
    .getByTitle(&#39;PolicyRoles&#39;)
    .items
    .select(&#39;Title&#39;,&#39;ID&#39;)
    .get().then((items: any[]) =&gt; {
        return Promise.resolve(items);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
        console.log(&#39;Error ensuring list: &#39; + error.message);
        return Promise.reject(&#39;Error returning list&#39;);
    });
}</code></pre>

<h2>What&#39;s next for it?</h2>

<p>I would like to add some more magic to the look of it by using Isotope to give better animation to filtering. It would also be great to introduce search as well so that it searches the content alongside the tags themselves.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day, I was doing a deployment to Azure Functions and I sat there and knowingly clicked right click and publish. I had a CI/CD Pipeline on Azure Dev Ops but I still did a right click publish. Now this isn&#39;t the right thing to do. This doesn&#39;t check that it works on other machines, this doesn&#39;t log it with release comments and it doesn&#39;t run automated tests. But I knew this was all ok. I knew it wasn&#39;t the completely right thing to do but I was ok with that. Does that make me a bad person?</p>

<h2>Let&#39;s take a trip back in time</h2>

<p><img alt="Time warp" src="/images/2018/12/timewarp.jpg"/></p>

<p>A little bit of history about myself. I started working in an investment bank in the UK on the technology side on a graduate programme. From day one, it was all about getting stuff done, it was all about keeping the traders happy, keeping them making money. I was learning new technologies but just enough to be useful. It was not necessarily about making sustainable code the majority of the time, it was about getting it done quickly. There was a real hero culture with people working long hours just to keep things running. The louder voices that supported the main users were the big winnders. And this is how I started off.</p>

<p>After a couple of years, I had the opportunity to work in Singapore for the same company. I had never been obsessed with back-packing but wanted to see a new place from the inside so this was perfect. It also introduced me to a new way of doing development. Working with more people who had come through formal training in school on development techniques rather than many self-taught people, there was more of a focus on doing things the right way. There was also the massive benefit of a timezone gap that meant the majority of users in the UK were not really online until around three in the afternoon, meaning that the morning&#39;s were less pressured and time was spent working on the code. This was the early 21st century and so agile techniques were really starting to take off, even if not understood by the management teams (especially the Project Management Office) but it meant exploring different ways of gathering requirements and tracking work done.</p>

<p>I also started to introduce unit testing to my code, something I hadn&#39;t really heard of before. I pushed for the extra time to have automated tests instead of the more usual iterative hit and hope that I had done before. This made me think more about the repeatability of my code and reducing code complexity, improving my code to be more testable with interfaces and learning about Dependency Injection.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t just a coding lesson though. I started to see the benefit over the long term of doing things the right way. When I spent more time on work and made sure it all worked from the start, there was less of a need for long nights working out problems. Having regular daily calls with the users to ensure that we were meeting the right requirements was very different to the long phases of projects that we had done before. I thought about documenting as part of my code and learnt about the benefits of Behaviour Driven Development where users (or at least product owners) could understand the tests we were writing through well named code, helping ensure that we had understood the requirements.</p>

<p><img alt="Flying back from Singapore" src="018/12/jumbojet.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Applying my learnings</h2>

<p>A few years later when I moved back to the UK and there was once again the pressure to just get things done. However, it was different now. I had the knowledge on what was the right thing to do. I knew about having unit tests with more than 90% coverage and automated UI tests. I knew that we should have a daily stand-up meeting and run regular retrospectives to make sure that all voices were heard and we continuously improved. So I made sure I continued doing all this?</p>

<p>No, is the simple answer. The difference was that now I could make an informed decision. I did make sure that I had unit tests but there may only have been 60% or so coverage. We made sure that we got things done and when projects were larger than a few people, we had daily stand ups and tracked as user stories. But the retrospectives would often only happen once a quarter if at all. I would sometimes copy code directly in to Production if it needed a quick fix. There are definitely times I wish I hadn&#39;t but it all helped me get the right balance.</p>

<p>As I moved further in to the world of SharePoint, the same logic applied. I worked hard to know the right of doing things (i.e. never use SharePoint Designer) but if there was a genuine requirement to have a fully customised page to meet a need for the business, I would take that step. I knew enough to document it well and know that it would be painful later when we had to migrate but it was an informed decision.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Make sure you know enough about how to do the right things so that you also know enough about when to do the wrong things. Know what the consequences are and be prepared to take a known risk. Balance the devil and the angel on your shoulders with facts, not just a reckless push to get things done.</p>

        <updated>2018-12-18T06:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why some people do better at work, especially in large organisations, when they don&#39;t appear to be any better than others? They have a glow about them that makes them appear to stand out more and attract more attention. When it comes to promotions, they are ahead of others and mentioned by all levels - sometimes positively, sometimes negatively.</p>

<p>What is is about them that often makes them stand out? Confidence.</p>

<p><img alt="Confidence is the preference of the habitual voyeur of what is known as..." src="e.jpg"/></p>

<p>I have been listening a lot more to audiobooks in the last couple of years, including some autobiographies. One of the phases I went through was comedians and there was a common theme where they often did not think they were better than others and felt that there were others more naturally gifted than they were. Both <img alt="John Cleese" src="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/So-Anyway-Audiobook/B01KG20M68"/> and <img alt="Eddie Izzard" src="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Believe-Me-Audiobook/B0727KV8RP?qid=1547298136&amp;sr=sr_1_1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&amp;pf_rd_r=C07CHDQ4P51S9CCDGMP9&amp;"/> spoke on this and that it was their confidence to push on through that saw them get to way they are now. Yes, this absolutely needs to be backed with hard work but in the face of much adversity, especially for Eddie Izzard in the early years of his career, it was the confidence to keep going and that he was doing the right thing. Both John and Eddie came from an English public school system (which meant their parents paid for their education rather than the state for those not in the UK) and attribute a large part of this to their confidence. However, this isn&#39;t the only way.</p>

<h2>How does it help?</h2>

<p>This is where I will drop away from my nature of being scientific and evidence based and go with my experience and feeling. Confidence helps to keep you on a single focus. It ensures that you move ahead with one idea without the debate and slowdown that can take place with uncertainty. Confident people can usually pull people along with them, bringing teams together where uncertain teams can be pulling in different directions and meandering towards no ending.</p>

<p>The reason that others are drawn to them in big organisations is that the confidence to move forward gives direction to others when teams can feel drawn to different routes. Confidence ensures momentum and while it may not always be the best direction, the push forward can make if become a good direction.</p>

<h2>The risk of overconfidence</h2>

<p>But what if it&#39;s not the right path to take? What if that confidence blinds you to the problems and ignore the risks and red flags that are so obvious in hind sight? This is where balance is the key - holding enough confidence to get things done while being ready to listen to others and adapting based on it.</p>

<p>In my earlier career, a head of technology made a great difference where his confidence to make change drove through a modern program and helped to improve the way that technology ran. He took away a hero culture where the focus was on working hard rather than working smartly and gave focus to the organisation. Unfortunately, this took a bad turn when he stopped listening to any opposition and focussed on his way or no way. There was no listening to what was going wrong and so no adjustment away from bad paths. Soon, the dissenting voices were louder than the backers and it was time for a change.</p>

<p>The answer is to hold some people around you who you trust to tell you when you are wrong and listening to them. Don&#39;t be diverted by the noise of dissenters but do look back at why they are there and if there is merit to it rather than their own cross purposes.</p>

<h2>How can I get more confident?</h2>

<p>That&#39;s a great question and not one that can be answered in a short blog. The great news is that you can change no matter how old you are, as noted in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2015/02/26/build-self-confidence-5strategies/#6a6feb7b6ade">this article</a> from Forbes. Your neural plasticity is adaptable enough that you can change the way you think. Look back at what you have done well and stick to those for a while to build your confidence.</p>

<p>The other thing is to act confident. Both John Cleese and Eddie Izzard noted that they did not always have the conviction in things but acted like they did. This will have the dual effect of you appearing confident to others but it will also boost your own confidence. The way people treat you affects how you feel so appearing confident will help people treat you as confident and be a self-fulfilling cycle.</p>

<p>Finally, I would say that you should prepare and practice. As with sports, building muscle memory helps you succeed, the same is true mentally. By repeating activities, you will be comfortable with what is going to happen. Practice what might go wrong as well so that you feel prepared and don&#39;t panic as they hit. You can also read plenty of pithy lists online but don&#39;t get too hooked on those.</p>

<h2>Bouncing back from low confidence</h2>

<p>Now this is a hard one. It&#39;s often caused by an event such as an embarassing moment or a failure. Losing your job or having an argument with someone you respect. You get caught in a cycle where thinking about it can dominate everything and distract from what you are aiming to do.</p>

<p>So stop, take a breathe.</p>

<p>![Pause a minute](</p>

<p>Have a look at what happened before. What went wrong? Why did it happen? What was good about it? What did you learn? From all those things, what can you do to help make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again. How should you adjust your focus? Was it just a one-off that you should put to one-side? Only you can truly know. But whatever happens, do not let it entirely dominate and stop you.</p>

<h2>Tighten your tie, straighten your back and hold your head up high</h2>

<p>So now is the time to look at the projects you delivered well, the presentations that wowed the attendees, the flowers that grew, the goals scored in Fifa, the likes on Twitter and the refactored lines of code that shrank the project to half the size. Those things that made life better and made you shine. Remember that feeling and hold on to it because that was you and can be you again.</p>

<p>p.s. this is no excuse to <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-incompetent-people-often-seem-so-confident">just be incompetent</a>, only to make the most of your ability and stop the incompetents winning!</p>]]></content>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2019-06-08T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has now been 15 years since I first started working with SharePoint. My journey started with a project to roll out Project Server 2007 at a large financial services company. Naturally, we couldn&#39;t just go with a little configuration and so a consultancy with expertise in Project Server and SharePoint was brought in.</p>

<p>At the time, I was a cocky mid-20s graduate and couldn&#39;t work out why we couldn&#39;t just spend a couple of weeks with the manual and a dev server to meet all the requirements. I probably wasn&#39;t very nice to the consultants as l took on the arrogance of working in financial services in the early 2000s. However, I was won over completely by the expertise and leant a lot about how to work sustainably with SharePoint. The project went well and we soon had hundreds of PMs tracking their templated project documents in SharePoint with risks and issues in custom lists for each project.</p>

<h2>A bit of reality</h2>

<p>Soon the pain of development with SharePoint 2007 hit. These were days before established PowerShell so we had hoards of text files to copy StsAdmin commands from. Deployments frequently went wrong with sites being customised so that our shiny new updated templates wouldn&#39;t load. We had constant support tickets from Project Managers who couldn&#39;t work out how to create a page with an image on it showing their latest RAG status or asking why so-and-so couldn&#39;t see a document. We felt their pain.</p>

<h2>The power of SharePoint Self-Service</h2>

<p>Through this pain though, I also saw PMs creating their own custom lists to track assumptions and dependencies. l found users who had discovered email alerts on specific documents so they could make sure their project team knew as soon as something was published. After a couple of years of this being a project, a dedicated SharePoint team was set up and I moved over to this. People across the business saw the benefit of collaborating with SharePoint so l met with teams from legal, risk, operations and trading and helped them to set up basic systems to help automate their processes and make them more productive. But even more teams helped themselves and we only found out when we saw usage peaks in the stats for new sites. People were helping themselves to solve their problems in ways we wouldn&#39;t have thought of as we didn&#39;t live these processes day in and day out.</p>

<p>There were certainly pain points with allowing people the freedom to do what they wanted. The Nintex Workflow with 5000 actions that breached the maximum file size for a work was a new one even to the Microsoft Support team at the time! Quite how that person had the patience to manually drag and drop that many actions was beyond us. We also found business critical systems running from SharePoint lists that had no version history and limited ability to restore if someone deleted them accidentally. So we engaged with these teams and publicised the help we could offer as well as people being able to help themselves and where it made sense to move things out of SharePoint, we helped with that. We became the prototypers, creating simple applications to help teams build out better ideas of what their requirements were.</p>

<h2>Was it really that easy?</h2>

<p>The biggest problem was to get people started with SharePoint. As the Web 2.0 movement was accelerating and social networks were being established, SharePoint felt very antiquated. Getting people started with editing pages and negotiating publishing was a problem for many years. Giving people access on mobile devices and outside the core network took million pound projects.</p>

<p>All of this reduced a lot of that self-service benefit as only small groups who were happy to invest the time to learn were really getting the benefit. The starting hurdle was too high. The appetite for people to give it a go started to reduce after the initial excitement. We had 97% of the organisation using SharePoint on a monthly basis even though it wasn&#39;t the core intranet but the grumbles were growing. I worked at more organisations and saw similar things. We worked hard to improve that introduction to SharePoint but it was rarely easy.</p>

<p>Then Jeff Teper rejoined the SharePoint team and Modern was born.</p>

<p><img alt="Lookbook" src="/images/2018/12/building-blocks-hero-p-1080.jpeg"/></p>

<h2>The new SharePoint</h2>

<p>OK, I probably skipped a few years but this is a blog post and not a history of SharePoint. In May 2016, Jeff Teper launched an event called the Future of SharePoint and a vision for modern looking pages that would work across devices began. Suddenly, adding an image to a page was easy. For SharePoint Online, external access was a case of logging in for many people (with Multi-Factor Authentication recommended too!) and it would look good on all types of devices. It has taken a few years but the modern experience now covers the vast majority of the old functionality (yes, there will always be some things easier in classic pages before anyone starts).</p>

<p>Back to the point of this post, this has re-ignited the joy of SharePoint for me. The development model feels far more modern as well and more aligned to other ways of developing web applications. Extending SharePoint feels like you are actually extending and not just working another way to do similar things. The engineering team are engaging and open to discussions which is a huge shift to the earlier years.</p>

<h2>Time for me to make a change</h2>

<p>All of this has made me want to look at a more Office 365 and SharePoint focussed role and so I am sad to say that I will be shortly leaving <a href="https://ballardchalmers.com/">Ballard Chalmers</a> but very excited to announce that I will be joining <a href="https://www.cps.co.uk/">CPS</a>. One of the big reasons for this is I hope to get more engaged with the community and have more time to attend user groups, conferences and work on community projects. I have been following a lot with PnP and other initiatives but hope that this will be give me more headspace to focus on the Office 365 and SharePoint world more and not the broader Azure and cross Microsoft that I have been doing in the last two years.</p>

<p>So why did I open with a story about a consultancy that helped to teach me the right way to develop on SharePoint? That consultancy was Corporate Project Solutions, now known as CPS so I really have come full circle in the world of SharePoint. I can&#39;t wait to get started and get out to meet people to help deliver solutions that help people to help themselves.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the areas that classic SharePoint sites still have over Modern SharePoint is the ability to target audiences. I had heard that this had changed so I decided to do a little investigating. The video below runs through that little trip, with the bumps along the way.</p>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvtxUOqZS2I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<p>What I found was:</p>

<ul><li>For any of the targeted content to work, you need/will need to be on Targeted Release for your tenancy.</li><li>I hope this will change but it only appeared that you could set the Target Audience on a Communication Site not a Teams Site.</li><li>You can create audiences but they don&#39;t compile so don&#39;t get tricked - you will need to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership">Azure AD Dynamic Groups</a> which requires a P1 license</li><li>If you change the order of news articles, remember to delete the custom order if you delete an article or the stub remains but the link breaks</li></ul>

<p>Looking forward to more updates on this to close the final loops.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2019-07-06T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever looked at the daily background on <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a> or the version on your desktop? Did you stop and wonder where that beautiful landscape or haunting castle is? Perhaps you turned to a colleague and said &quot;I wonder where that is? Where do you think&quot;. Then you did the same the next day and perhaps another colleauge joined in. This then turned in to a game amongst the team. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and soon the whole company was playing. Suddenly, a little bit of fun was taking up loads of time for the poor person who first came up with the idea.</p>

<h2>Automation with Bots</h2>

<p>This little tale inspired me to take a look at making a Bot in Teams that could do the same thing but with more automation. What would a Bot look like that could ask someone to choose an image and then send it round to the team, allow them to guess where it is, work out which guess was closest and then set a winner. Well, you will be happy to know that I can tell you now. It looks like the Daily Bing Challenge Bot.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Demo One" src="/images/2019/07/Bot demo 1.png"/></p>

<h2>Triggering the challenge</h2>

<p>To trigger the challenge, someone just needs to @mention the @BingBot and say Check Daily Results. This wakes up the Bot to choose the first Bing image. I say first because there are actually seven different regions I have found for the Bing images and will they are sometimes the same, they can often be different images. As you can see in the image above, an adaptive card shows the Bing picture with the region it is in. There are then three actions:</p>

<ul><li>Choose image - this tells the Bot that you are happy with that image and the game can be triggered</li><li>Try another image - if that one doesn&#39;t quite work for you, try the next Bing image
<img alt="Bot Demo Two" src="019/07/Bot demo 2.png"/></li><li>Switch to Google - let&#39;s cover this in a bit more detail</li></ul>

<h2>Adding a little Google Places</h2>

<p>We found that many of the Bing images were a little too easy to guess so I added an alternative using Google. The Bot would pick a random number for longitude and latitude and then look for any places with photos in a 50km radius (the maximum that Google can choose). If it didn&#39;t find anywhere (e.g. somewhere in the middle of the ocean), then it would try another random point. This would happen forty times before it confessed to the user that it couldn&#39;t find anywhere. Then it&#39;s up to the user to try again or switch back to Bing.</p>

<h2>Time to guess</h2>

<p>Once a suitable image has been chosen, the Bot will save the image details and then start asking for guesses.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Demo Three" src="ot demo 3.png"/></p>

<p>As you can see in the image above, the Bot knows how many users are in the Team and how many have responded so far. The guess is validated as a real location and it can handle slight typos as well e.g. Lundun for London or Rio de Janeero for Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<h2>Choosing a winner</h2>

<p>Once all the results are in, the winner is calculated and a new card is shown with the winner. If you don&#39;t want to wait for all the guesses to come in (for example, someone is on leave) then you can reply &quot;Check results&quot; to trigger the results checking.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Demo Four" src="/images/2019/07/Bot demo 4.png"/></p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>So the winner has been told and everyone knows where the actual photo was and how far the guess was. The challenge is complete for the day. So what does that mean for the longer term? Time for some Power BI.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Demo Five" src="/images/2019/07/Bot demo 5.png"/></p>

<p>To drive some competitiveness, a Power BI Report is set up and hosted as a tab in Teams. It shows the top guessers as well as a map of the last 30 days of results. The team can keep a track of their results and the most successful winners over time.</p>

<h2>Driving adoption for Microsoft Teams</h2>

<p>Most importantly though, they can use Microsoft Teams to do it every day. The Team members don&#39;t just have to chat to the Bot, they can chat to each other, laugh at bad guesses or just generally be impressed by the quality of the photo. Then they can start discussing their projects in another channel, adding their own Power BI tabs for project status or other tabs. Driving adoption of Teams through experience.</p>

        <updated>2019-07-11T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stepping away from the Daily Bing Challenge Bot <a href="/2019/07/06/daily-bing-challenge-bot.html">overview</a> and <a href="/2019/07/09/installing-daily-bing-challenge-bot-copy.html">setup</a>, this post covers the processes to go through when designing a Bot. This won&#39;t be too much of a technical post as it is targetted at the analysis side of the solution but will point towards where you can find out more about the Bot Framework elements themselves.</p>

<p>For this blog, I will use the example of a Bot to work with Microsoft Project Server, something that is of big interest for <a href="https://www.cps.co.uk">CPS</a>. It is intended to make some of the more tedious tasks a little easier.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The first steps are to work out what you want your Bot to do. That may sound like an obvious thing but the range of things you can do with a blog is huge so getting down on paper what the aims are is key. Start with which user types you think will be involved, then move on to the sort of tasks they will do, focus on a few of those and map out the journeys that those tasks will take.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s think about the key groups of users. As with many application designs, my initial design was using OneNote as a whiteboard so I have taken those sketches here.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design User roles" src="/images/2019/07/Bot Design User Roles.png"/></p>

<p>The roles shown cover the three main groups that would be using Project Server at a basic level. What sort of tasks would they do?</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design Tasks" src="/images/2019/07/Bot Design Tasks.png"/></p>

<p>Chatting through the different options with a CPS colleague, we thought through the more tedious tasks that there are and what would be useful. Project Managers and the PMO often live in Project and Project Server so wouldn&#39;t get too much benefit but team members are far less likely to be in there. Having responses in Teams means that they will be in the tool they live in more often so the focus should be on asking for and providing status updates.</p>

<p>We also use Project Server to determine where staff are as they are allocated to projects and so you know where they will be. This can also be important for knowing where you are meant to be too.</p>

<p>Once we had a list of all the tasks, it was important to pick a few tasks to focus on initially to get an MVP.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design Tasks MVP" src="019/07/Bot Design Tasks MVP.png"/></p>

<h2>Creating a user journey</h2>

<p>Given these initial tasks, we talked through what the journey would be for the user. How they would start, the questions they would be asked, the expected responses and the completion part. Some of these would take multiple paths but others would be more basic.</p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design DPU journey" src="/images/2019/07/Bot Design DPU journey.png"/></p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design DPU assignments" src="/images/2019/07/Bot Design DPU assignments.png"/></p>

<p><img alt="Bot Design DPU chase updates" src="/images/2019/07/Bot Design DPU chase updates.png"/></p>

<h2>Designing the bot structure</h2>

<p>We have a good idea on how things should flow as an app now. How should we think about that as a Bot? The key is to think about the blocks of chat which are known in the Bot Framework as a dialogue. Each of the journeys above could be thought of as a dialogue. You would want all in the same Bot but need a way of transferring between those conversations.</p>

<p>The main dialogue will be the entry point to the Bot, the start of the overall conversation. This should be like the centre point of the mind map above and needs to know what the initial aim of the user is. There is a great service in Azure which can help this called <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/">Luis (Language Understanding Intelligent Service)</a>. Within this service, you can define a set of intents i.e. buckets that you would like the conversation to move in to. For each of these intents, you can create some phrases that the user might type and then the AI built in to the service will expand on these.</p>

<p>If each of our journeys above becomes an intent then the phrases could be:</p>

<pre><code>- Chase timesheets for all staff
- Chase overdue tasks for project Phoenix
- Where will I be on 15 March
- Can I provide my DPU</code></pre>

<p>Each of these will be analysed and the objects extracted (e.g. Timesheets or the project name) and the details then passed on to the dialogue for each journey.</p>

<p><img alt="Chatting" src="/images/2019/07/chatting.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Designing a dialogue</h2>

<p>The dialogues work exactly like the flows above. Either a question is asked to start the dialogue or it receives the details from the main dialogue via Luis. The Bot will react to the responses as they are due, retrieving data from other services like Project Server as required. Once the Flow has finished, the dialogue is ended and the conversation returned to the main conversation.</p>

<p>The dialogues could be treated like a screen or set of screens in a traditional application where you consider which buttons the user will press and what text they will enter. If you consider the UI to be like a wizard then the Bot fits that design well.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s pretty simple, right? Mostly, yes, it is but where the complication can appear is all the exceptions to that simple flow. With a standard UI, it is easy to add a close or cancel button that will always be there. With a Bot, you need to ensure you consider these and build them in to the code.</p>

<p>For example, in the Whereabouts example, what if they decide to change the day halfway through? Or if they disagree with the assignments there? Or perhaps just want to have a general update not related to a specific assignment. You may say that they can&#39;t do these things but you need to design the Bot to make sure they don&#39;t try. Otherwise you end up with someone&#39;s daily update saved as &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to bloody provide an update on that ridiculous project, give me MY project&quot; or something similar. People are inclined to write sillier stuff in response to an automated Bot than they might in a standard UI due to the chatty nature so it is something to be aware of.</p>

<h2>Managing state</h2>

<p>One other thing to consider is that people do not always reply straight away. Especially in the case of the chase task update dialogue, people are likely to come back to it later and your Bot will need to consider that.</p>

<p>The Bot Framework manages this through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0">state providers</a> for the dialogue. By default, this is held in memory but this should be changed for live use to be held in something like Table Storage or Cosmos DB. This will then held the current state of the conversation indefinitely.</p>

<p>However, there can still be some confusion when you have a Teams Bot with multiple people replying, with some replying within the thread and some creating a new thread. These can have different impacts and so you need to think of the inputs that are possible at each of these states and what to do if the user replies with something you are not expecting.</p>

<p><img alt="Adaptive cards" src="/images/2019/07/Bot design adaptive cards.png"/></p>

<h2>Adding a little UI</h2>

<p>While the focus is on text based responses, you can also make use of adaptive cards within your Bot that are supported by most of the end channels. This allows you to return images and elements of structured text as well as introducing buttons that can guide the user to a response. It may not always be appropriate to use adaptive cards as they are larger and so can fill the screen and hide the bulk of the conversation. However, they add some elegance and uniqueness to the user as well as adding additional guidance to the responses that can be made.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>To summarise the steps from above, the key is to treat the design in a similar way to a standard application with your user roles, journeys and similar screen design. Where things differ is that you need to consider a lot more about how the user may step away from the standard journey. You need to build in ways for them to exit this journey when required and make it obvious to the user how that can be done.</p>

<p>Make use of cards where appropriate to help with the user guidance and bring a little bit of a visual element to the mostly text based interface. remember that these are often called chat bots so be prepared to design responses in a chatty way while balancing the risk of becoming increasingly annoying - yes Clippy, I&#39;m thinking of you.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2019-07-09T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="/2019/07/06/daily-bing-challenge-bot.html">previous post</a> in this Bot Series covered what the Daily Bing Challenge Bot is and where it came from so now I will cover how you can use it. This is a technical post and there are quite a few steps at the moment. I may look to create an ARM template and remove the need for Google API at a later date but for now, here is how you can have your very own Daily Bing Challenge Bot.</p>

<p>In a few areas, I point to other documents or blogs with how to do things (like create a Bing Maps API). The reason for that is they can often change so I want to ensure that it has the latest info.</p>

<h2>What has to be done</h2>

<p>To get the Bot in place, the following steps are needed:</p>

<ul><li>Create Azure Bot Service including the App Insights</li><li>Create an Azure Storage instance</li><li>Create a Bing Maps API Key</li><li>Create a Google Places API Key</li><li>Clone the code from Github</li><li>Update the app settings</li><li>Test locally</li><li>Publish to Azure</li><li>Add to Microsoft Teams instance</li></ul>

<p>So let&#39;s go through those step by step. These steps do assume a working knowledge of Azure but <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk">send me a tweet</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<p>If you just want to take a look at the code, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/DailyBingChallengeBot">here</a> - there will be a later post describing the code itself.</p>

<h2>Create Azure Bot Service</h2>

<p>To deploy the Bot, you will need an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free">Azure Subscription</a>. I have used free services as much as possible or low cost for low usage such as Azure Storage. However, I cannot guarantee the costs involved.</p>

<ul><li>Create a new Resource Group</li><li>Add a new service to the Resource Group, searching for &quot;Web App Bot&quot;</li><li>Fill out the details as in the image below - you can use free pricing tier</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 1.png"/></p>

<ul><li>Choose the default Bot Template</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="019/07/installing the bot 2.png"/></p>

<ul><li>Create a new Service Plan but note that it defaults to S1 - this can be reduced to the free tier.</li><li>Include App Insights</li><li>Let the App ID and Password be autocreated</li><li>You may need to enable some Resources which can be done by:<ul><li>Selecting Cost Management + Billing from the left menu (or under All Services if not available)</li><li>Select your subscription</li><li>Select Resource Providers from the left menu<ul><li>Search for the resource that requires registering and select Register</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Wait for the resources to be completed</li></ul>

<h2>Create an Azure Storage instance</h2>

<ul><li>Return to the Resource Group and add a new service</li><li>Search for &quot;storage account&quot;</li><li>Choose Standard performance</li><li>Choose Storage V2</li><li>Choose Locally Redundant Storage (unless you want to pay more for extra redundancy)</li><li>Choose Hot Access Tier</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="019/07/installing the bot 3.png"/></p>

<p>Once created, you need to create a table called DailyBing (or if you call it something else, note it down for later)</p>

<h2>Create a Bing Maps API Key</h2>

<p>To get a Bing Maps Key, follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key">here</a> and then keep hold of the key for a later step.</p>

<h2>Create a Google Places API Key</h2>

<ul><li>Click on Get Started at https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro (you will need to sign in with a Google account)</li><li>Select the Places API</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 4.png"/></p>

<ul><li>Add a project name and agree to the terms of service</li><li>Sign up to a free account - you will have to enter a debit or credit card but no charges will be made unless account upgraded to full account</li></ul>

<p>Keep the API key for later steps.</p>

<h2>Clone the code from Github</h2>

<p>Clone the code from <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/DailyBingChallengeBot">https://github.com/kevmcdonk/DailyBingChallengeBot</a> in whichever way you like.</p>

<h2>Update the app settings</h2>

<p>In the code, there is an appsettings.json file that should be full of empty strings - if it isn&#39;t, please let me know so I can remove any keys I have left in!!!</p>

<p>Here are where you get the settings from:</p>

<ul><li>Add the Microsoft AppId Microsoft App Password, Luis API Hostname, Luis API Key and Luis App Id created for the Bot Service<ul><li>In the Azure Portal, go to the Web App Bot created</li><li>Click on Configuration on the left menu</li><li>Show Values and then copy the values across</li></ul></li><li>Add the storage connection string<ul><li>In the Azure Portal, go to the storage account created earlier</li><li>Click on Access keys in the left menu</li><li>Copy the Connection String for Key1 to appsettings.json in DailyBingTableConnectionString</li></ul></li><li>Add the Table name<ul><li>In the Azure Portal, go to the storage account created earlier</li><li>Click on Table in the left menu</li><li>Copy the name supplied in to appsettings.json in DailyBingTableName</li></ul></li><li>Add the App Insights Instrumentation Key<ul><li>In the Azure Portal, go to the App Insights instance created</li><li>From the default Overview page, copy the Instrumentation Key</li><li>Paste it in appsettings.json under the INstrumentationKey area</li></ul></li><li>Add a Bing Maps API Key<ul><li>Copy the key created earlier in to appsettings.json under BingMapsAPI</li></ul></li><li>Add a Google Maps API Key (yes, at the moment it uses both! The photos were better in Bing)<ul><li>Copy the key created earlier to appsettings.json in GoogleMapAPI</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2>Test locally</h2>

<p>At this point, everything should be working. Now is the time to test that theory!</p>

<ul><li>Build the code and confirm that it compiles without errors</li><li>Run the web project</li><li>Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0">Bot Storage Emulator</a> to test the results locally</li></ul>

<p>At the moment, it will still write the results to Azure Storage but you could update the appsettings to use a local storage emulator instead. You can test by following some of the steps in the <a href="/2019/07/06/daily-bing-challenge-bot.html">previous post</a> and can even debug each step to understand what is happening.</p>

<h2>Publish to Azure</h2>

<p>If all is working well, right click on the project in Visual Studio and publish to Azure, following the wizard instructions</p>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 5.png"/>
<img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 6.png"/></p>

<p>You can then test with the emulator again or proceed to deploy the bot to Teams</p>

<h2>Add to Microsoft Teams instance</h2>

<p>The final step is to deploy the Bot in two Microsoft Teams. The simplest way to do this in order to test is to click on the edit icon next to the Teams search box and enter the Microsoft App ID for the Bot</p>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 7.png"/></p>

<p>To deploy for a Channel to test, you first need to add the app <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-app-studio">App Studio</a> by clicking on Apps in the bottom left and searcing for App Studio</p>

<ul><li>Once added, select the Manifest Editor Tab then Create a New App</li></ul>

<p><img alt="Web App Bot creation" src="/images/2019/07/installing the bot 8.png"/></p>

<ul><li>Give it a short name like BingBot and a Long Name of Daily Bing Challenge Bot</li><li>Paste your Microsoft App ID in to the App ID field and give it a suitable package name and version e.g. com.me.myapp.bingbot v1.0.0</li><li>Think up a suitable short and long description (note that they must be different!)</li><li>Enter our name and website in the developer info</li><li>Enter the App URLs with details of privacy and terms of use policy (if internal, a SharePoint page would work well)</li><li>Upload an icon, a transparent icon and pick an accent colour</li><li>Slightly confusingly, you then need to select Bots from the left Menu under Capabilities</li><li>Click on Set up and choose Existing Bot</li><li>Give the name and the Microsoft App Id and then tick Personal, Team and Group Chat, leaving the others blank</li><li>If you want to, you can add a command to make it easier to ask for the start<ul><li>Click Add under Commands</li><li>Enter the text &quot;Check Daily Bing&quot; in Command Text and &quot;Trigger the Bot to start the daily challenge&quot; in Help text</li><li>Tick all three Scope boxes and click Save</li></ul></li><li>On the left menu, select Test and distribute and then Install your app in Teams for Testing</li><li>Search for a Team in &quot;Add to a team or chat&quot;</li><li>Pick the Channel and then click Setup</li><li>It is now set up to Test in Teams but for it to respond, you also need to enable Teams as a channel<ul><li>Navigate to the Azure Portal and go to the Bot</li><li>Click on Channels in the left menu</li><li>Select the Teams logo from &quot;Select a featured Channel&quot;</li><li>Click on Save</li></ul></li><li>It can sometimes take a few mins for the first response</li></ul>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>After all that, you should have a working Bot! If you don&#39;t, the first ports of call are the App Insights logs in Azure or the Web Service logs - these should give an indication of what is wrong. Feel free to log an issue in the Github repo if you are having any other issues.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2019-08-13T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost since SharePoint Communication Sites were first announced, the clamour has been there to be able to have the root site be a Communications Site. An image driven, good looking site at the natural place for an Office 365 tenancy. Then, at this year&#39;s <a href="https://sharepointna.com">SharePoint Conference</a>, Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Updates-to-SharePoint-security-administration-and-migration/ba-p/549585">announced</a> that the PowerShell commandlet <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/invoke-spositeswap?view=sharepoint-ps">Invoke-SPOSiteSwap</a> was coming and would allow admins to swap out the current root site with another one (with a few provisos that I&#39;ll let you read in detail).</p>

<p>Awesome, I thought, my shiny Communications Site can now be shifted to be where most people would expect it. I fired up PowerShell and connected up to the site. Ran the command. Boom. Nothing happened except an error.</p>

<p><img alt="Swapsite not supported" src="/images/2019/08/swapsite-not-supported.png"/></p>

<p>Humph. Turns out that the tenancy was on standard release so I could be waiting some time before I got my shiny Communications Site I had stupidly promised. The good news was I remembered a <a href="https://hangconsult.com/2017/06/29/change-sharepoint-online-root-site-collection-to-use-the-new-communication-site-template/">workaround</a> involving saving a Communications Site as a template, deleting the root site and then setting it with a custom template. Not perfect and not supported but it would work. As I didn&#39;t want to try out deleting the root site on the main tenancy without being certain what would happen, I used my <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program">Office Developer subscription</a>. I copied the url for saving the template, plugged it in and...</p>

<p><img alt="No access" src="019/08/no-access.png"/></p>

<p>Oh. I can&#39;t access that any more. That&#39;s a pain. But I can be a stubborn beast so wanted to make sure that there was definitely no way round it. I took the plunge in the dev subscription and deleted the root site, safe in the knowledge that I would be able to recreate one...I hoped. I used the new admin centre to delete, making sure to permanently deleted it and clear all record of it.</p>

<p><img alt="Delete current site" src="019/08/01 Delete current site.png"/>
<img alt="Permanently delete site" src="2 Permanently Delete it.png"/></p>

<p>I tried out using some of the PnP commands like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/new-pnpsite">New-PnPSite</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/new-pnptenantsite">New-PnpTenantSite</a> but neither worked unfortunately. So I decided to try and create a blank site where I could choose the template later, as the earlier post recommended. It was a risk as I had no Communications Site template saved but I thought it was worth a look. Why did I think that? Well, I had seen that there was a Communications Site template listed when I ran <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/get-pnpwebtemplates">Get-PnpWebTemplates</a> so I was hoping I might be lucky.</p>

<p><img alt="Create new site using other options" src="a new site using other options.png"/>
<img alt="Select more templates" src="more templates.png"/>
<img alt="Create site with select template later" src="site with select template later.png"/></p>

<p>So I now had a site but without a template. I tentatively browsed to that site and started looking through the template options. Oooo, what is that there?</p>

<p><img alt="Select publishing" src="/images/2019/08/06 navigate to created site and select publishing.png"/></p>

<p>Under the publishing tab, there was Communications Site. I selected that, created the default groups and there it was, a Communications Site at the root.</p>

<p><img alt="Communications Site at root" src="/images/2019/08/08 comm site at root.png"/></p>

<p>Fantastic, I was done! Except it occured to me that this tenancy was on targeted release. I took the risk to follow the same steps on the main site (it wasn&#39;t in active use yet) and thankfully I found the same thing. I had a working Communications Site.</p>

<h2>Caveat Emptor aka be careful using this</h2>

<p>So here is the large disclaimer. This is not a supported method. My recommendation would still be to either wait for Invoke-SPSiteswap to reach standard release or change the tenancy to use targeted release. This method may suddenly stop working (in the way that Save Site As Template is now blocked) and it could impact the live running of your tenancy.</p>

<p>But if you are wanting to put a Communications Site at the root while on Standard Release, then I can confirm that on 13 August 2019, it does work.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blimey - it’s almost 2020. All those 2020 visions now need to be reviewed and likely refocused. All those visions of the past can be checked and realisation that we still don’t have flying cars or our own jet packs (most of us anyway). So will the world change massively next year? Probably not. It will carry on but those small changes we don’t notice will continue their trickle in to our daily lives. The ease that AI is starting to bring, the emergence of voice interfaces will continue, Internet will be everywhere and the ability to consume what media you want, when and where you want will keep the diversity of content at a high. What about in the world of Microsoft 365?</p>

<h2>Microsoft Search will become the one search to rule them all</h2>

<p>Microsoft Search was first kicked off in 2017 with Bing For Business but formally became Microsoft Search at Ignite 2018. It promised one place to get all your Search and by Ignite 2019, it is really starting to deliver on that with the ability to include custom sources and customise how the results are returned using Adaptive Cards. Combined with more endpoints being made available in Microsoft Graph, this means more ways of getting access to your content.</p>

<p>But it’s certainly not there yet. It is often confusing in SharePoint as to when you are using plain SharePoint Search and when Microsoft Search kicks in. Tools like Teams have their own search. It can also be hard to bring back results from across different systems in one go.</p>

<p>This is all changing though and being a viable solution to use. With the custom connectors, it can truly form a hub to your whole organisation and power one place to go to find information. 2020 will see the final updates that mean it can be your one search and allow control over how those results are displayed and auctioned.</p>

<h2>Here come the robots</h2>

<p>Bots have been around for a while in the Microsoft ecosystem but the recent changes are in how they are created. The tooling is opening up as people better understand which areas are working well (access to existing knowledge, answering questions, support) and focussing on those areas. Making it easier to structure the conversations mean more helpful Bots and better handling of the often unstructured nature of chat.</p>

<p>Power Virtual Agents (which I spoke about before as Dynamics Virtual Agents) were a great way of structuring the trigger point for a conversation and the flow of each part of that. They are limited in what they can do and, in my opinion, now an expensive way for most people to benefit from Bots but with Bot Framework Composer, there is a similar feel for building those conversations but with a more technical backing in the Bot Framework leading to more control over exactly what you want.</p>

<p>These will help understand what is possible and drive more realistic implementations. Smaller Bots for specific purposes, working together to give an improved digital workplace.</p>

<h2>Cortex will dazzle but…</h2>

<p>When Project Cortex was announced at Ignite, it quickly became the most talked about topic. The ability to easily but intelligently tag content and make it easy to find that content with knowledge hubs. Soon though, the most takes about topic became about licensing and how much it would cost.</p>

<p>My prediction is that it will be seen as a great tool, much like MyAnalytics when it came out. Then the same issue that MyAnalytics had will kick in - it will be too expensive for most organisations to justify. Large multinationals will start to embrace it and it will find a well loved niche but it won’t hit mainstream.</p>

<p>The areas that will take off though are the accompanying tools such as the new term set admin and other metadata related content. This will position organisations to structure their content and then hopefully, in a few years, Cortex will start to branch in to the E3 world without add-one and gain wider acceptance as a central tool that all use.</p>

<h2>Spaces will remain quiet</h2>

<p>When SharePoint Spaces was announced in 2018, it became a very Marmite product - people loved it or hated it. Many couldn’t see the point but for me, as one of the lovers, I could see Microsoft positioning themselves for the augmented reality future. This was about the time when glasses would show content and about building out for a new way of interacting with that content.</p>

<p>Sadly since the announcement, not much more has appeared. There were some details at Ignite about a public preview coming in 2020 but nothing else. Even more sadly, I see this slow movement continuing as people still don’t have enough content to show and there isn’t enough momentum in AR to drive a big marketing push yet. However, keep watching as I believe that it&#39;s time will come and it&#39;s a worthwhile investment.</p>

<h2>Custom dev in Microsoft 365 will grow and grow</h2>

<p>For any who attend the regular PnP calls or seen Vesa Juvonen speak at a conference this year know, the growth of SPFX has been phenomenal - the fastest growing development framework in Microsoft&#39;s history. In my experience though, I still see an overwhelming push to use out of the box with SharePoint Online and avoid the pain that many have felt over the years with highly bespoke SharePoint implementations. There have been small occasions where a small request has been met with SPFX for customers but more often they want to not have to manage custom code.</p>

<p>However, with the use of SPFX for Teams custom tabs and the upcoming expansion across Microsoft 365, I see increasing demand for those custom apps. Not just using PowerApps but building single page applications (SPAs) to give exactly what is wanted. Power Automate and Power Apps will definitely make a difference but dev teams will be able to do more in a deployable and manageable way with SPFX. This will increase the amount it is seen and hopefully raise the profile of custom dev.</p>

<p>Another big driver will be the news that <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/sharepoint-framework-community-call-recording-5th-of-december-2019/">AppSource will support SPFX</a> since organisations can start to monetise SPFX web parts. When companies can make money from it, there will be a bigger push for third parties to modernise their stack to make the most of this. This will lead to more SPFX happening and be accepted as supportable too.</p>

<h2>There will be more license fights with big backtracking by Microsoft</h2>

<p>2019 saw several big license changes, especially around Power Platform and I think 2020 will see this continue. I feel that the early Satya days of moving to a friendlier and open source Microsoft are still there but the reality hits that it is a large company and does need to monetise on this. This will always lead to overstepping the mark that customers are comfortable with and upsetting partners as they did when they said they would remove Internal Use Rights. In some cases, we will see backtracks again as we did with the Self-Service purchasing not being able to be disabled. However, expect to be disappointed with licenses and prices in the new year still. That way, you&#39;ll be less disappointed.</p>

<h2>A new decade, same push to productivity and collaboration</h2>

<p>So it will be a new decade but don&#39;t expect to feel a massive change suddenly to the way things work. Don&#39;t expect a massive leap in to the future. Why? Because we are already there.</p>

<p>The desires that we had at the start of the decade to be able to work better together wherever we are and have more intelligence in what we do and really being recognised. Getting to work you do faster and with the ability to better focus are all in place, helping you find the right content is getting there soon and being able to access from anywhere now feels natural.</p>

<p>This won&#39;t feel like a big leap because everything is moving forward at a constant pace of an improvement. Look back at where we were ten years ago with little automation, huge amounts of manual processes, little remote access and silos throughout an organisation and then look at many places now and see the change. Not everywhere, I agree but the momentum is well and truly established and it is easier than ever to do. That ongoing change with continue in to the 2020s and 2030 will see us all feeling the new way of working as being the only way to be. We might even have some jet packs.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2010 - that feels a lot longer than ten years ago. I was not long back from Singapore, still adjusting to non-expat life, fighting the ever-worsening commute from Kent up to London, juggling childcare duties with wanting to be out drinking. My twenties had just gone and responsibility had hit in a big way. At home with a 3 year old and at work as I took on more and more running of the whole SharePoint farm for a 30k seat investment bank that was the only company I’d ever worked for. One of the things I was learning more and more about was how to run things in an agile way effectively and my favourite things that have come from almost twenty years of the Agile Manifesto (http://agilemanifesto.org/) is:</p>

<blockquote><p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p></blockquote>

<p>What better way to reflect on my decade and come up with some plans for 2020.</p>

<h2>How I run the retrospective</h2>

<p>As an overall process, I like to run retrospectives by:</p>

<ul><li>Capturing feedback<ul><li>What went well</li><li>What went badly</li><li>What should I do more of</li><li>What should I do less of</li></ul></li><li>Identify key topics and match captured notes</li><li>Create tasks for 3-5 of the key topics</li></ul>

<p>This lets you look at the past but also use those items to plan for the future too.</p>

<p>Usually, I would use post-it notes on a wall with a group of people but as this was all about me, I decided to try a more technical and environmentally friendly approach. I like post-it notes for the concise nature of what is captured and ease of moving things around so I wanted something like that. I liked the ability to have handwriting rather than the more formal text as well.</p>

<p>This time, I decided to use <a href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-whiteboard/digital-whiteboard-app">Microsoft Whiteboard</a> for this as you can have your own notes and also your own Note Grid (currently in preview) which you can use to group the notes.</p>

<h2>Capturing feedback</h2>

<p>Starting with the notes, I spent 30 mins thinking back over the last ten years. I scribbled thoughts as they came along so some were high level, some were very specific, some are obvious to all and some won&#39;t make sense unless you know me well. The important thing is to capture that stream of conciousness and to be honest with yourself.</p>

<p><img alt="Capturing feedback" src="/images/2019/12/post-its.png"/></p>

<h2>Identifying key topics</h2>

<p>To determine the topics is much more of an art than a science. Look across each of the feedback sections and aim for areas of commonality. For my feedback, there were some obvious topics like Homelife and Learning in there but then I went a little more creative with Quality not Quantity. Quite a few of the feedback items were about doing too much and so I wanted to look in to how I could get more quality. I also noticed quite a few things about travel and grouped this with conferences. After a few more tweaks, I had my groupings.</p>

<p><img alt="Feedback grouped by topics" src="/images/2019/12/grouped-by-topic.png"/></p>

<p>I&#39;ll delve deeper in to each area.</p>

<h4>Quality not quantity</h4>

<p>It was interesting here that I found no things that had gone well! Not sure that this is strictly true as one of the benefits is that I have a very broad understanding of topics. However, this is balanced by the fact that I take on too many different things and have too many unfinished products. I also have a tendency to read lots of different things (articles, tweets, books, blogs) but in a quick way rather than choosing my quality topics and spending time on them. Similarly, I watch TV in the background without concentrating fully and end up only half doing whatever I am usually doing on the laptop. These are all areas that I can do more on, focusing on two or three things in a day rather than picking up too much. Also, keeping a routine and consistency, especially with the blog and sharing content - picking up key stories rather than a scattergun approach.</p>

<h4>Productivity and planning</h4>

<p>Similar to the previous topic, I tend to deviate and not focus. While I always aim to plan what I work on, I will also drift on to topics that interest me instead or areas that I feel work well for me at the time. Sometimes I am in the mood to do some dev, sometimes to create a PowerPoint, other times it&#39;s blog writing. I work best when I fix to this but that&#39;s not always the work that needs doing.</p>

<h4>Volunteering and open source</h4>

<p>It feels great that I have contributed one thing back to the PnP programme but it is nowhere near enough. I have had various aims of incorporating some of the projects I&#39;ve done back in to one of the programs but now would like to look at what others need doing instead and work on that. I&#39;m happy that my blog has had a good gradual uptake although I do need to focus on this more to get consistent content. Meanwhile, the community is an amazing aspect to Office 365 and I would like to look at how I can better help rather than being a net taker from the community.</p>

<p>Outside of the Microsoft world, I am also a Cub leader and love the work I do there. Being able to see the children develop while having fun is a real balance to the day job, the chance to get outside more and enjoy real life. Having said that, my aim for this year is to help teach coding to the Cubs and get together something that others can use as well. Building a new generation that understand the tech is very important to me, giving the opportunities for those to thrive who love getting fingers to keyboards and giving more experience to those who haven&#39;t seen it.</p>

<h4>Homelife</h4>

<p>Looking back over ten years, there has been a huge change on this side. I was still getting used to being back in the UK and we didn&#39;t know many people nearby. Since then, we have moved in to a slightly bigger house and have some amazing friends locally. We&#39;ve added two more kids and two more cats to the family (sadly losing one cat who came over from Singapore) and my son earned a place at one of the best schools in the areas. My personal highlight of the decade though was putting on my own festival for my wife and I&#39;s 40th birthday back in May. Around 150 people, three different bands, 5 different zones, crafting, games, decorations and our own festival logo.</p>

<p><img alt="Squadgefest" src="/images/2019/12/Squadgefest.png"/></p>

<p>What hasn&#39;t been so great is that the friends I so missed when in Singapore still feel as far away now we&#39;re in the UK. We just don&#39;t make enough time to travel and see them as much as we&#39;d like. I also need to get better at making mental space when things are busy at work as juggling that, three kids and a cub pack can too easily get on top of me.</p>

<h4>Learning</h4>

<p>Learning has always been key to me, always important to keep on top of the latest news and be trying new things out, not just reading them. Over this decade, I have very much become cloud first and make use of a wide range of Azure items. What I haven&#39;t done though is convert that in to an actual qualification and so one big focus for 2020 will be to put that in place.</p>

<h4>Travel and conferences</h4>

<p>Luck has been with me this decade as I have been able to attend several big conferences and not just in the UK with Vienna and Prague for ESPC. I haven&#39;t yet hit one of the really big US Microsoft conferences but there&#39;s still time and I have enjoyed many of the UK smaller ones like Future Decoded and the Ignite World Tour. Seeing people speaking there has inspired me to speak at user groups in the past year and the conversations with those have been great - definitely an area I want to continue into the 2020s.</p>

<p>This has given me a chance to travel a little and changing from being on the client side to the consultant side has allowed me to see even more of the UK, from Falmouth up to Newark so far. Previous roles have taken me to New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo among others but I haven&#39;t seen as much in my own time as I&#39;d like. As the children grow up, this is something I would like to do even more and hopefully use the SP Saturdays to do this too.</p>

<h4>Worklife and management</h4>

<p>Looking back at some of my achievements since 2010, I can&#39;t help feeling proud and a little smug here - sorry. The SharePoint Farm for over 30,000 users was a pleasure to manage and the stories of how it was being used in ways I never imagined (usually a good thing...) really drove my love of SharePoint being an enabler. As the cloud world kicked in and I moved to consultancy, I saw even more of what people could achieve with the tools that were there.</p>

<p>Having said that, I am certainly not where I thought I would be. I imagined being at the Director level for a Financial Services company, leading a large team and I am in a very different place to that. I am though, happier and less stressed and enjoying a lot more being able to help people in many different places, with the chance to help at charities too. Something I have also dreamed of is winning the lottery and putting in place a consultancy to offer low cost help with being more collaborative and productive in a modern age. Having had the chance to do that to some degree, it has only strengthened that dream.</p>

<h2>Turning a retrospective to actions</h2>

<p>After that reflective look back, it&#39;s important to look forward to and so I am now the lucky owner of a Planner board with tasks for several of those key topics. Let&#39;s see in twelve months how they are all looking!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ignite, Build, ESPC, Future Decoded, Collab Summit, SharePoint Saturday - you might be like me and look at that list and think “I wish I could have been at all of those, I’ve seen the superstar speakers attending and know they’ll be my drinking buddies forever if only I had the chance to go cos they love the same things I do”. And then you get to go. And the events are great. The sessions are amazing, you learn so much…from afar. You see those people who go up and ask a question at the end and consider it but decide that your question isn’t quite worth it. So you head back to the expo floor and consider chatting to someone but think that maybe you don’t have enough to say. And someone might find you out. Then you see your favourite MVP over there, maybe Karuana Gatimu, Christian Buckley or Andrew Connell. They liked your tweet once so you should say hello. Bit you worry about interrupting them. You don’t want to spoil their day. So you go and have another coffee and head back to wander round the expo floor.</p>

<p>I’ve done this. Quite a few times. Then a couple of years ago, I thought this was silly and at Future Decoded, I said hello to someone. At the Ignite Tour, I chatted with Gregor Suttie after being some impressed by his blog and then Penny Coventry, Chirag Patel and Tony Pounder. Then I submitted to speak at a few user groups. At this ESPC, I finally felt comfortable and said hello to all the MVPs and Microsoft people I’d tweeted before. It felt weird. It felt completely out of my comfort zone. But it felt great too.</p>

<p>I also chatted to random people sat near me. I spoke to people in the queue for the party. I joined a meet up and watched some football together before carrying on for more beers with the two people I was with. We spoke about Brexit, the Everton manager, kids growing up and Harry Styles. For a little while, we spoke about work too. But that wasn’t the whole aim. It was just nice to get to know someone. And that is what a lot of these events are about.</p>

<p>Those people who seem unapproachable will be jet lagged, be missing their wife and kids, be hungover, be thinking about work, probably the same way you are. But they aren’t here for the money, they are here to chat. So ask that question. Say hello. Get to try and know them. Say thank you for what they do. Appreciate them.</p>

<p>But also chat to the people next to you. Join that spare table at the party and chat to new people. I did. I met someone who was so happy that she had rolled out a new Teams instance in a Google heavy company. I met someone who helps with European telescopes in Chile. Turns out they have the same worries about what to do as their kids grow up as I do.</p>

<p>These are the chances to learn more from people and make new connections. Take that chance. Be that friendly person. It could change your whole career. Or it could just make you feel happy for the rest of the day, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of your heart devoted to it...</p>

        <updated>2020-01-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ignite - The World Tour. London. January 2020. Microsoft brings along some of its biggest names in the Power Apps world to the Excel Centre.</p>

<p>In the morning, <a href="https://twitter.com/donasarkar">Dona Sarkar</a>, principal advocate for the Power Platform promises a brand new <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23powerplaty">Power Platy</a> sticker for anyone who shows a Power App to her or <a href="https://twitter.com/8bitclassroom">Brian Dang aka 8bitclassroom</a>. I&#39;m a sucker for a sticker so showed my <a href="https://www.mcd79.com/2017/03/20/i-do-not-like-green-eggs-and-ham-sam-i-am-2.html">kitchen calendar app</a> and now my Surface has a little less space. It didn&#39;t stop there though.</p>

<p>The Ignite Tour is great as it helps those of us who struggle to afford the trip over to the US and shares some of the best of the sessions. I was a little disappointed with the range of talks this year but there was a heavy sway towards AI and also Power Platform. As I had breakfast on day 2, I was hatching a plan. Could I write an app in a day that combined the best of both? The answer turned out to be not quite - a combination of too much chatting to the community (always worthwhile) and wobbly wifi for most of the day meant that I had to finish it off this morning but I think the end result was worth it.</p>

<h2>Share Their Tweets</h2>

<p>The main aim of the app was to integrate the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/">Face API</a> and possibly some other <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Cognitive Services</a>. The rest of it slowly evolved from there. As I was among many MVPs and other knowledgeable people who share much of their learnings on Twitter, I thought that it might be good to introduce some of that. So how does it work?</p>

<p>The home page lets the user take a photo and it will try and recognise a face in that photo (just the one at the moment). If they are in the list, then it will show a list of their tweets with the option to show any that they are mentioned in. Then if you click on two of the icons along the top, the app will now extract either a set of key phrases from the last thirty tweets or the entities used by running them through the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/">Text Analytics Cognitive Service</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Homepage" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-Home.jpg"/>
<img alt="Tweets" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-Tweets.jpg"/>
<img alt="Entities" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-Entities.jpg"/></p>

<p>The rest of the app is about setting up the people who can be searched for. From the homepage, you can click on the people icon to see a list of people. There you can also add another person by taking their photo, adding their name and Twitter handle. The app also allows you to add additional photos to help train the face list for a person further.</p>

<p><img alt="People" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-People.jpg"/>
<img alt="Add Person" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-AddPerson.jpg"/>
<img alt="Add Person Face" src="/images/2020/01/ShowTheirTweets-AddPersonFace.jpg"/></p>

<p>Want to see a live demo?</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I promised at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSIgniteTheTour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref<em>src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#MSIgniteTheTour&lt;/a&gt; in London yesterday a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerApp?src=hash&amp;amp;ref</em>src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PowerApp&lt;/a&gt; out - didn&amp;#39;t quite manage it then but finished it off this morning. Using FaceAPI, match the person to their Twitter profile and show their tweets. Writing up for blog soon! Thanks to 2yr old for co-commentary... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fSKqUrtBAH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fSKqUrtBAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kevin McDonnell #MSIgniteTheTour London (@kevmcdonk) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk/status/1218533436572545026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>So how does it actually work?</h2>

<p>In a simple summary, the app stores a list of people in a SharePoint list, the photos are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and a Power Automate Flow is used to process the photos using Azure Cognitive Services. It would be great not to need the Blob Storage as that pushes the need up to the more expensive tier but the Face API Connector requires a public facing URL holding the image to be processed - strangely, the Face API itself can be called with a streamed image but that capability is not available in the Connector.</p>

<p>The Face API requires a Person Group to hold a list of people that can be matched against. An image can be processed to detect faces that are then added to a Person Group Person. Each of those Persons can then have a face compared with them to identify the likelihood that the face matches one of those. This is a little complex at times and using the <a href="https://westeurope.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236">Face API documentation</a> to test the different calls can really help. This is especially true during testing as the Power Apps and Flow connectors don&#39;t allow you to delete a Person Group or Person.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>There are still areas that need improving. Most notably, there is little error handling and support for things like the photo not detecting a face or the API calls failing for whatever reason. The list of people should also set up checks against the Person Group Persons to ensure that they exist and how many trained faces have been set.</p>

<p>It would also be interesting to try and pull out photos of someone from their Twitter handle so it could learn from Twitter rather than live photos. It would need a mechanism to pick whether the person was in the photo but that is possible. A little more work will be needed to check the media URLs held for the tweet which is why it hasn&#39;t happened yet.</p>

<p>This post has been kept as a high level overview but I will spend a bit of time to run through some of the details such as how to upload a photo as a blob, how to call detect face on that and how to link it to a Flow in later posts.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s always nice to hear some feedback so let me know what you think. The PowerApp and Flows have been exported to GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ShowTheirTweetsApp">https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ShowTheirTweetsApp</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted a set of policies around how people should use Office 365/Microsoft 365? Do you find yourself repeating the same little bits of advice to people again and again and again? We&#39;re not talking about adoption specifically here, more about &quot;Hey, you should always make sure you reply to a conversation in Teams rather than starting a new one&quot; or &quot;Keep files just for you in OneDrive and move them to the appropriate team&#39;s SharePoint when you want to work together&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there was a place to get all these useful suggestions in one place?</p>

<p>Welcome to the etiquette of Microsoft 365!</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.greyhatbeard.com/">GreyHatBeard podcast</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk">myself</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/al_eardley">Al Eardley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytrinder">Garry Trinder</a> (the Grey, the Hat and the Beard of <a href="https://twitter.com/greyhatbeard">GreyHatBeard</a>) work with many clients on the best ways to use their licenses for Microsoft 365. This isn&#39;t about the technical implementations, it is about how people can best work together with the services available and in ways that keep everyone happy.</p>

<p>The original list originated from a brain splurge by Al on a long train journey and then was extended during a podcast with Garry and Kevin who were joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/marijnsomers">Marijn Somers</a> for an <a href="https://www.greyhatbeard.com/2020-02-21-show4part2/">episode of the GreyHatBeard podcast</a>. This triggered an idea of this repository and site where others can help build up a community driven collection of great advice. The more hints and tips that can be combined, the more rounded the advice can be.</p>

<p>Over time, we hope that this will evolve so that the content can be used within your own organisations, through extracts, SharePoint WebParts, Bots and other ways to re-use the list. This may be a complete extract or a selection of the useful elements that you would like to include.</p>

<p>For now, please use the etiquette tips and help to contribute your own items through Pull Requests. Any suggestions? Drop GreyHatBeard a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/greyhatbeard">Twitter</a> on raise an issue in the GitHub repo.</p>

<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>The purpose of this site is to be able to collect and share all those useful suggestions for the right way to use Microsoft 365 services and put them in a way that you can choose the ones for your organisation and share.</p>

<p>At the moment, these are all in Github and can be copied as markdown files from there but the attention is to be able to create downloadable packages so you can host your own site similar to this but also have it on SharePoint or in Teams so it is there front and centre.</p>

<p>What is even better is that we want this to be community driven so if you have your own tips, then feel free to add them. If you have a good idea on how to share them internally, raise an issue and then get started with building it.</p>

<p>Sharing is Caring.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read a blogpost telling you that you should focus and just laughed? Do you really see the point of focusing on sticking to one thing or do you just think you need to get on with all these different things as they are all a priority? What is the point of focusing?</p>

<p>Well the honest answer is that we are finding out right now. We are seeing people able to focus on one thing because that is the thing that is front of most people&#39;s minds – Covid-19. What if you have to invent a new ventilator to try and save more lives? <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52309294">People have done it</a>. What if you had to find a way to inspire thousands through a national singalong or clapping along to support the NHS in the UK? <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52319191/coronavirus-uk-residents-clap-for-our-carers">People have done it</a>. Why have things like this not been happening all the time, why has it taken a global crisis for this to happen? The answer is focus. When you focus on one clear thing, you can get it done. It’s not always easy to focus but the power of it can be seen as we look around and read the news right here right now.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Have a listen to our <a href="https://www.greyhatbeard.com">GreyHatBeard podcast</a> on the subject or read on.</p>

<p>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0uhfXIgSBvdf9EGcNsRJDl&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<h2>So how do you focus?</h2>

<p>As with many solutions, there’s always a harder question to answer. How do you dedicate your time to one thing when there are all sorts of challenging priorities around you? When the kids need you to help them with their homework, your wife is asking what shopping is needed for the weekly trip, your colleagues are asking how to solve something and HR is asking whether you need to take that leave and all at the same time, how do you focus on getting just the one thing happening?</p>

<p>If you try and juggle all those different things, you are unlikely to get any of them done and context switching between the different things will mean you are less effective on each of them. By the end of the day, you will be exhausted and your to-do list won’t have changed. You will finish with substandard results for each task, unhappy family, agree work life and probably no leave to recover.</p>

<h2>Prioritise</h2>

<p>So the first step has to be to list and prioritise. Sorting out which is more important is hard but first you need to get everything down so that you can. For me, I like to use Microsoft ToDo as it will already pull my tasks from Planner but you could use a piece of paper or post-its too (these are better as you can then sort). Work through the list and decide then on what has to be done first.</p>

<h2>One thing at a time</h2>

<p>Now that you have a list of things to work through, you can look at one thing at a time. Shut off your notifications, ignore you email and work on that one thing until done. If it&#39;s too big, then break the task down a bit but stick to the one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Leave some time for emails and other social media but don&#39;t keep swapping between different things. Just get one done at a time.</p>

<h2>Use your environment and equipment</h2>

<p>To stop yourself from being disturbed, use technology like noise cancelling headphones and think about where you sit. Pick places where you won&#39;t be disturbed. Use different desks (or rooms in the house at the moment due to lockdown) for different tasks so your mind is in the right place for it. Some places for documentation, another for meetings, somewhere else for coding perhaps.</p>

<p>Also use different music, podcasts and audio books for different types of work. High tempo for coding works for me but lower intensity for writing documents and reading articles. For repetitive tasks, having an audio book or podcast in the background works.</p>

<h2>Where can I find out more?</h2>

<p>There are so many things out there on focusing, amusingly enough to really distract you. Great books such as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00M8PUC8K">The Organized Mind</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00SHL3V8M">Getting Things Done</a> will help. Or take a listen to <a href="https://www.greyhatbeard.com/2020-04-17-show8part2/">GreyHatBeard</a> - we&#39;d love to know what you think!</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-08-09T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Search was announced as the single search for finding items across the whole of the Microsoft 365 world back in 2017 during the Ignite that year. One backend to reference so that no matter where you search from, you get the same results back. That&#39;s the promise and that is gradually coming to fruition. I will cover more on how this looks in SharePoint but this post will look in to the Dev side - how can Microsoft Search be used in a SPA (aka Single Page Application - sorry, no massages here)?</p>

<p>TL;DR - take a look at the code at <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa">https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa</a> to see how it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>That fateful conversation. &quot;I really like this but can it look a bit less like SharePoint?&quot;. It&#39;s a hard one as Modern SharePoint offers so much to people but there are those that have been bitten before and just don&#39;t want the flexibility that SharePoint brings and don&#39;t want the space grabbing that it can take as well. Usually, I try and push harder but in this case, there was little that the client wanted outside of the ability to easily search enterprise content. They wanted a way to get to their other web applications and other content faster. What did they like? Microsoft Search.</p>

<p>The power that Microsoft Search offers to index content from a multitude of places has increased the interest. It allows users to search content from across Microsoft 365 in a single way, knowing that results will come back the same regardless of where you search from. It also now allows you to pull content from outside of Microsoft 365 so that your single search can be aligned to all of your content. I spoke more of this at the <a href="https://events.collab365.community/globalcon1-agenda/">GlobalCon1 event</a> run by <a href="https://collab365.community/">Collab 365</a> that you can sign up for the <a href="https://partners.collab365.community/13990/41362">All Access Pass</a> to view, including an eBook on the subject.</p>

<p>What was announced at Ignite in 2019 was that this search would now be available using the Microsoft Graph. There are only certain areas available at the moment such as searching files, events, messages and external items - you can read more in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta">Graph Docs</a>. The sample that I have put together makes use of these APIs as well as some others to retrieve SharePoint info. Sadly, not quite all the needs are available in Graph so I&#39;ve had to make some SharePoint REST calls too but we&#39;ll get to that.</p>

<h2>How it looks</h2>

<p>The UI focuses on the ability to search for contents with a large search box as the focus. Below that, it shows the trending news and then follows up with other trending items using the Graph and SharePoint APIs.</p>

<p><img alt="Main page" src="/images/2020/08/mssearchspa-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img alt="Second half of main page" src="/images/2020/08/mssearchspa-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>The search bar returns results straight away and uses the Adapative Cards to render the results although these could do with some improving to look a bit better!</p>

<p><img alt="Search results" src="/images/2020/08/mssearchspa-3.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Framework</h2>

<p>The overall app utilises the Next JS framework to create a static app that can be hosted on Azure Storage. This makes it very cheap to run and relatively simple once the code is compiled. Azure DevOps can build and deploy all the files and get the site running in minutes. Which is nice.</p>

<p>Next JS is an opionated framework focused on Single Page Applications with React. It handles the routing and used WebPack to run dev locally with the Hot Modules - all the things you would expect from a modern framework. Big thanks to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/garrytrinder">Garry Trinder</a> for getting this set up as it makes things a lot smoother than my original, pure JS version. He also put plenty of work in to the other elements so huge kudos to that man.</p>

<p>I used MSAL to utilise Azure AD for authentication and Office UI Fabric for the UI. The final part to help with rendering the search results is to use Adaptive Cards and Adaptive Templates. For the rest of this post, the focus is on the API calls (Graph and SharePoint) with a little Adaptive thrown in too and most of these are located in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa/tree/master/services">Services</a> folder.</p>

<h2>Calling the Microsoft Search Graph APIs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa/blob/master/services/search.js">Search.js</a> file shows how the Search API is queried. It receives a token that is retrieved from MSAL and accepts a searchQuery, a string that contains the query that is comes from the search box the user types in. The call is pretty basic with the only addition being that you can control the number of results to return and whether to skip results, allowing you to page through records.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/5cb7f9a6a72f58628dd57e826af49489.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>The limitations really are that you can only return one entity type at a time. To return all events and messages, you would need to make two separate calls and merge them. Same with files (aka Drive Items) which slightly differs from the one search message at the moment. It does simplfy the response though as the entities returned are just those that you search for.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Cards and Templates</h2>

<p>The results returned from search are nicely rendered from the Graph using Adaptive Cards. These are used in the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer/preview">Graph Explorer Preview</a> to show how the results can be rendered which demonstrates the direction of importance that these are taking.</p>

<p>The best place to find out more about Adaptive Cards is at <a href="https://adaptivecards.io">https://adaptivecards.io</a>. There you can view samples as well as use the Designer to build your own cards.</p>

<p>The card templates are used in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa/blob/master/components/search.js">search.js component</a>, rendering the responses back from the Graph or SharePoint calls. The templates themselves are held as JSON files in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa/tree/master/cards">cards folder</a> and added in to the component. The key packages used are adaptivecards, adaptivecards-fabric and adaptivecards-templating which combine to allow you to render the UI in a Fabric friendly way. You can see below that can add some config like the default font (good old Segoe UI in this case) and that you can create an action for when actions take place with the card.</p>

<p>The templating is still in preview so approach with caution and be ready for some changes although I found that it worked pretty well once you find the right samples. However, if you have used previously, it is worth noting the breaking changes as of May 2020 noted at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/288e71d02b60e49889f982530a273119.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>Getting News from SharePoint</h2>

<p>To get the news from SharePoint, I would love to use Graph but at the time of developing it, there was not enough support for the Search of news articles so I went back to using the SharePoint REST API. I added a filter for the Page content type and also for PromotedState as 2 to ensure that it was just News pages and not other standard pages.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/09a4dd977f7f4fec418d927d1ea82518.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>Trending Items</h2>

<p>For the trending items, things were a lot easier as I could make use of the trending insights functionality in the Microsoft Graph.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/aa229abc623037431860a33fe6d80999.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>Using SitePages API</h2>

<p>One of the areas that could be a little controversial in this code is the use of the SitePages API. This is used in SharePoint itself for actions on SitePages but is not formally supported as there is no documentation for it. I made use of it to return specific news pages filtered to only return files (the filter of FSObjType=0). However, the risk of using this is that it may stop working at any point so should be used cautiously.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/59924e7072bb4286cb7fa8ec3a84f302.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>While I was happy with how this works, I would love to implement a little more to help with testing. Firstly, I would extend the existing Cypress tests to do a full UI test based on some of the great work that Elio Struyf has done.</p>

<p>Next, I would improve this with deployment scripts that set up test data to use in a fresh environment wiht sample applications set up to be searched. It would also be good to get additional services to understand better which applications are in use and show those as the first option.</p>

<p>Any other ideas you have, I&#39;d love to hear them via <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk">Twitter</a> or as suggestions in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/ms-search-spa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">GitHub issues</a>.</p>]]></content>

<p>Your current reaction probably sits in one of three places if you live in the Microsoft space.</p>

<ul><li>&quot;I&#39;m so excited&quot; - you can&#39;t wait for darter and all the benefits it will bring to ease access to information,</li><li>&quot;It&#39;s going to be too expensive&quot; -you might be excited about it or not but either way, you just don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get the budget To get anywhere with it.</li><li>&quot;Erm, what is Cortex?&quot; it may be that you haven&#39;t heard about Cortex and the buzz that started at Ignite in 2014 -checkout https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex as a starter or
listen to our first Grey Hat Beard show</li></ul>

<p>Regardless of your current state of mind or Cortex,
the aim of this series of posts is to get you thinking about knowledge in your environment.
Where is it stored, how do your store it, formal
informal knowledge and how can you get access to that knowledge for the right people at the right Time. Much of this will be made easier by Cortex but you can gain huge advantages by implementing some of these suggestions Without Cortex and if you will be
implementing Cortex then you will still need to
plan for many of these things.</p>

<p>• Add something about what is knowledge management
• aim is to connect those with knowledge to those who want (need knowledge
To help this series to be practical as well
• theoretical, lam going to demonstrate
some of the practices using the Greybeard
etiquette of Microsoft 365 content. the
ones will contain:
-Considering where knowledge is stored -Organising knowledge
-Creating a culture of knowledge
-Records management us. knowledge might

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many ways to start a knowledge management journey such as starting in one specific area of your organisation, focusing on a set of key stake holders or just building a business case for the value of a large scale program of work. For this series, I will focus first on where your knowledge is stored, considering the different areas and ways that information can be held. This will help you later to consider how you make use of that information to help the right people at the right time.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is part two of the Knowledge Management series. For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href="/2020/09/03/Knowledge-Management-Series.html">Part One - Introduction</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>So where would you find knowledge in your own organisation? Your are probably thinking of formal locations such as your Intranet, support guides, wikis and formal documentation. You may also be thinking of less structured areas such as your departmental shared drives or your Share Point Team Sites for collaboration. But what about all those conversations people have in Teams and in email, chats that take place in meetings and all that incredible experience stuck in people&#39;s heads? I bet that you can think of many times where you have read a formal document but still needed to contact the author or even someone else that you know with the experience. With even the best Knowledge Management programs, huge swathes of knowledge will still be stuck in people&#39;s heads. So what should you do?</p>

<h2>Types of knowledge</h2>

<p>Knowledge can be broken down into two key areas:</p>

<ul><li>Explicit knowledge - knowledge captured for the purpose of holding knowledge<ul><li>Structured content - e.g. Record management systems</li><li>Unstructured content - e.g. File shares, wikis, meeting minutes</li></ul></li><li>Tacit knowledge - knowledge held informally that can be hard to share with others<ul><li>Discussion forums</li><li>Enterprise social media</li><li>Emails</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>A third area sometimes cited is implicit knowledge which is the knowledge that is primarily in people&#39;s heads. If you think back to when you joined a new organisation or a new team, then there is always that time where you pick people&#39;s brains about what to do and how to do things. If you are lucky, then there is a page or document that lists things out but there is always that implicit knowledge not written down even if it is as simple as the best time to beat the crowds for the coffee shop.</p>

<p>You can think of these three areas as a scale with explicit knowledge in structured areas being the hardest to capture and maintain but the easiest to search and navigate knowledge and implicit knowledge being the hardest to find but easiest to capture.
<img alt="Types of knowledge" src="/images/2020/09/TypesOfKnowledge.jpg"/></p>

<h2>So where is your knowledge held and what types of knowledge do you have?</h2>

<p>Do you have formal record management or document management? The first steps to getting your knowledge into a usable state is to build out a knowledge map which helps you to capture the areas with knowledge at that point in time. It is important to realise that it will be an iterative process as you start to think about the knowledge, discover locations for that knowledge and then realise other areas of knowledge. If you are looking for more assets on knowledge maps then APQC (<a href="https://www.apqc.org/">American Productivity &amp; Quality Center</a>) have a lot of tools available, some for free but most for members. Much of what I have learnt recently has come from one of their books, <a href="http://www.newedgeinknowledge.com/">The New Edge in Knowledge</a> which I would recommend even though it is a little old now.</p>

<p>The video below is a replay of a mapping of the Etiquette of Microsoft 365 knowledge, considering where useful knowledge could be held to learn more about etiquette insights similar to those we have captured for GreyHatBeard. You can see that I think about the main areas and then start extending that to specifics where known and building out the connected areas. It can also be useful to start considering at this point how much knowledge you have in each area and how much you would like to have.</p>

<p><img alt="Mapping etiquette of Microsoft 365" src="/images/2020/09/MappingEtiquetteOfMicrosoft365.gif"/></p>

<p>You may be looking at this and thinking that this is far too basic for an organisational knowledge map. That is certainly true and this lower level example would work better for an individual team or area. <a href="https://www.apqc.org/">APQC</a> include a set of examples of knowledge maps for enterprise, cross-functional and process/role based maps in their <a href="https://www.apqc.org/system/files/K06334_Getting_Started_Knowledge_Mapping.pdf">Getting Started with Knowledge Mapping</a> document.</p>

<p>The important consideration is not about the technical systems themselves but the knowledge in them and how it is used. That is the key really - how is it used. Which brings us neatly on to the next in the series on how you can organise your knowledge.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Organising can seem such a boring word. Organising is the opposite of spontaneous, it&#39;s the planned dinner you can&#39;t be bothered with instead of the quick pint after work that turns into an epic night out. It&#39;s what the young you is terrified that you will turn in to. It is also what makes things just work. It is what makes you be able to be productive, to be able to get on with what you need to do and be the most effective you can be. It&#39;s the front-row seats at the O2 after hours spent with multiple windows to get the tickets. But yeah, it is still a bit boring.</p>

For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href="/2020/09/03/Knowledge-Management-Series.html">Part One - Introduction</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/10/Knowledge-Management-Series-Considering-where-knowledge-is-stored.html">Part Two - Considering where knowledge is stored</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<h2>So why do you need to be organised with your knowledge management efforts?</h2>

<p>In the <a href="/2020-09-10-Knowledge-Management-Series-Considering-where-knowledge-is-stored.html">last part</a> of this series, I talked about working out where your knowledge is held and in many cases, that can be pretty large areas. The example I gave for the etiquette of Microsoft 365 includes Twitter and that is certainly a big place to find information. Being organised means that you can extract/use useful information at the right time from those larger sources.</p>

<p>How though? How do you sort out the huge volumes to be useful? The starter point is to define your taxonomy of information, define how it is that you can categorise knowledge. To be able to understand your knowledge, you need to be able to have ways to classify it into areas, whether it is curated manually or defined with articificial intelligence. A central taxonomy helps to:</p>

<ul><li>bring standardisation across your organisation</li><li>navigate knowledge</li><li>reduce confusion of common terms</li><li>reduce redundant information</li><li>match to analytics on usage</li></ul>

<p>Creating the taxonomy is not an easy task and is something that should be done with as broader a group of people as possible.</p>

<ul><li>Consider the areas that you would apply to knowledge and how people will use that knowledge.</li><li>Consider the areas containing knowledge outlined in your knowledge map and how that would be categorised.</li><li>Consider specific pieces of knowledge and how they could be categorised.</li><li>Consider how a hierarchy of the terms could be created.</li><li>Consider your taxonomy to be iterative and plan for change.</li></ul>

<p>With those tips ringing in your ears, it is time to start building out a taxonomy for the etiquette of Microsoft 365.</p>

<h2>Building a taxonomy for the etiquette of Microsoft 365</h2>

<p>The taxonomy can take several forms. For the etiquette, the natural place to start is the navigation that is already in place in the <a href="https://greyhatbeard.github.io/m365-etiquette/">repo</a>. These are:</p>

<ul><li>By service - a more technical approach to the different services in Microsoft 365</li><li>By approach - a grouping of different ways of using the services</li><li>By scenario - specific scenarios to consider when using services</li></ul>

<p>These have naturally evolved from the contents used and so these make sense to start with. This can be extended with a similar notion of which groups of user it is relevant for, i.e. would it be standard users or power users or perhaps just for admins to consider. Another area added is for the strength of the advice to help guide people consuming the information as to how much they should consider the recommendations. Finally, the source of the knowledge was added which will allow for analytics to be run on the content at a later date.</p>

<p><img alt="Taxonomy for the Etiquette of Microsoft 365" src="/images/2020/09/EtiquetteTaxonomySketch.jpg"/></p>

<p>The next step (not one that I&#39;ve undertaken quite yet) is to start mapping samples of your content itself using this taxonomy. Identifying exceptions that don&#39;t fit this taxonomy is important as it helps you to work out whether you need to extend the taxonomy or allow some bits of content to not quite fit. Looking at <a href="https://greyhatbeard.github.io/m365-etiquette/By-service/teams/">Limitations of Private Channels</a> in our repo, there&#39;s some great advice but it doesn&#39;t feel quite like it fits the must, should, might level exactly and hard to say if it would be for power users or admins. We will need to make a decision as to whether we update the content there or adapt the taxonomy. We will certainly need to break many of the pages into smaller blocks as parts of the pages have a real mixture of content. This shows a good example of working out whether to change your taxonomy, change your content or perhaps to have a transformation process into a central repo is the right thing to do.</p>

<h2>How to store your taxonomy</h2>

<p>This is always a tricky one to answer. The important factors to consider are:</p>

<ul><li>Visibility to all</li><li>Ability to consume with APIs</li><li>Clear ownership</li><li>Ability to request additions and changes</li></ul>

<p>There are many services that can be purchased or databases built with APIs to support these factors. Coming from a SharePoint background, my natural position would be to store these in the taxonomy service and I will dig further into that in a future post in this series, considering how to make it more visible and easier to request additions and changes for all staff.</p>

<p>For the etiquette of Microsoft 365, all the content is held currently in a <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/m365-etiquette/blob/master/docs/metadata.yml">YAML file</a> with indents to show the taxonomy within that. It&#39;s an early beta so not yet extensive but gives an idea of how it will look when past the OneNote. The downside with YAML files is adding additional metadata such as alternative names capturing owners in the way that you could in the SharePoint Managed Metadata service. A future change could be to create a JSON file to hold this with the additional details as attributes. But this works nicely for now and for this series.</p>

<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kevmcdonk/60dd92ffc914348edf8a226ddcbd67cb.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h2>What about an onotology?</h2>

<p>Some of you reading this may have heard about ontologies as well as taxonomies. For me, the simple difference is that taxonomies will have a single hierarchy for each item in the taxonomy. Ontologies allow for more complex relationships to be put in place such as where departments and functions of an organisation may overlap. A taxonomy would be described in a tree view whereas an ontology is more like a web diagram linking different nodes.</p>

<p>If you are unsure, then stick with the simpler taxonomies as these are easier to implement with services like SharePoint Managed Metadata. As your information becomes more complex, then you could consider moving to the more complete ability to map relationships with an ontology instead.</p>

<p>For more information on the differences, the following articles may help:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/03/24/taxonomies-vs-ontologies/#79e714f57d53">Forbes - taxonomies vs ontologies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.earley.com/blog/what-difference-between-taxonomy-and-ontology-it-matter-complexity">Earley - What is the difference between taxonomy and ontology</a></li><li><a href="https://pediaa.com/difference-between-taxonomy-and-ontology/">Pedia - difference between taxonomy and ontology</a></li></ul>

<h2>Driving change and adoption</h2>

<p>Once you have begun the process of planning your knowledge, it is vital that you have a broad set of contributors, that you have opened up to people who will be using the metadata to make sure that you have the right information in place. For example, if your metadata includes an organisational structure but your HR systems use a different approach to your Finance systems then you have already excluded a large part of your potential user base. Engaging well and early with your key users of the metadata will help to ensure that the organised knowledge will be used - it may make things take longer as you adapt to different needs but it will be time well spent for later.</p>

<p>Broadening out to more users initially can lead to a much higher scope of work so be prepared to engage with areas that you may open up to later, be prepared to disappoint some people initially so that you can gain momentum instead of being bogged down in never ending requirements definition instead of earning some value. Don&#39;t be afraid of adapating an agile/continuous improvement approach to your knowledge metadata, being open with progress.</p>

<p>You should also make sure that you consider how the metadata will be managed:</p>

<ul><li>How will people request changes?</li><li>Who will have ownership of different areas?</li><li>Will there be an automated approval process?</li><li>How will you know what is being used and what isn&#39;t?</li></ul>

<p>The SharePoint Managed Metadata service, as I mentioned above, isn&#39;t great at these things so it is important that you consider how you are going to handle the requests, how you will monitor usage up front. It may be that from day one that you won&#39;t but do plan to get scripts in place to help with this or engage with some of the great third parties that are out there.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>As with many collaboration systems, governance is key to Knowledge Management and organising your knowledge to ensure easy access and understanding will make sure that it is used effectively. Building up the metadata so that you do not always have to pull your data into one place gives you the flexibility needed for modern agile organisations while also giving that standardised structure to keep things consistent.</p>

<p>Engaging with others is key and part of that change and adoption is building a culture where people do understand the value of sharing knowledge and people are encouraged to actually do it. Building that culture is the subject of the next blog post.</p>

        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-09-17T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Culture - something many people are accused of lacking and something organisations strive to have. It&#39;s a hard thing to actually define though. When it comes to knowledge management though, it&#39;s a little simpler as what I am talking about is does your organisation encourage the sharing of information? Are people rewarded for working collaboratively and retaining the knowledge for the good of the organisation? Or are people encouraged to focus on themselves, hoarding information and not understanding the culture of sharing?</p>

<blockquote><p>This is part four of the Knowledge Management series. For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href="/2020/08/12/knowledge-management-series">Part One - Introduction</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/10/knowledge-management-series-considering-where-knowledge-is-stored">Part Two - Considering where knowledge is stored</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/14/knowledge-management-organising-knowledge">Part Three - Organising knowledge</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>The value of a sharing culture means that your knowledge management can become more valuable, leading to it being more used and building the benefits of productivity, innovation and togetherness. Staff can get information more easily and at the right time, allowing them to focus on getting done what they need to get done and inspiring them to build on the shoulders of others rather than recreating every single time. They can feel that they are working together with others to make the organisation the best that it can be, keeping employees engaged and excited about their job.</p>

<p>It seems a no brainer when put like this so why isn&#39;t everyone doing it? Well, some don&#39;t see the value in being so open, often because it can take time to be able to see the benefit to the bottom line and in some cases never seeing any improvement at all. Spending time to share things properly can feel like it is eating away at time that could be sent focused purely on the job. Thankfully, companies like AirBnB and Microsoft are showing the value in being open in what they are doing and demonstrating that organisations can be successful in doing it.</p>

<p>So the other reason why people don&#39;t? Because it is hard to know how to do it and it can take a lot of time and investment to change the culture of an organisation. I am going to try and approach a way that organisations can start to change that.</p>

<h2>Build Trust</h2>

<p>The most important thing when trying to change a culture and, in this case, build the culture of sharing is that you need to have trust. If people take the time to share then they need to know that they are not going to lose out by it. Creating good content that is then taken by others as their own with no acknowledgement is a great way to lose the trust and lead to people not sharing. Chastising staff for spending time in capturing their knowledge instead of getting on with things is another great way to lose that trust.</p>

<p>Connected with this is the building of a no-fail culture. Allowing people to share and capture the lessons learnt when things have not worked means that people learn together. Understanding why when you skip the testing or allow that technical debt to build, things fail and don&#39;t work well further down the line helps to build the support to do things properly. It helps to justify people sticking to their guns and insist that things are done properly. Without the trust in place to allow people to learn from failure without fear of reprisals, then people will play safe and let the problems hit later.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about learning from failure, <a href="https://medium.com/@ShaneLester2016/5-best-books-about-learning-from-failure-db1fe8b2fac1">this post</a> has some great books to read on the subject (with the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17859574-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big">Scott Adams one</a> already on my &quot;to read&quot; list).</p>

<h2>Highlight influencers who are sharing well</h2>

<p>As you build trust by not attacking failure and supporting the sharing of knowledge well, you can also take the positive aspect of highlighting the successes, especially specific people with influence within the organisation. In the modern culture where there is often a flatter structure to organisations and internal social networks allow people to influence through what they do as well as their role, this means that not everyone who can influence is a manager. By celebrating those that <a href="https://www.allthingsic.com/wol/">&quot;work out loud&quot;</a>, you encourage those behaviours and help others to learn how to do similarly themselves. Creating culture is about celebrating the things done well and promoting them widely.</p>

<h2>Top down sharing</h2>

<p>Your influencers are key but organisations are still heavily influenced by their hierarchies and messages from senior management. To encourage others to share, having senior managers share their own knowledge, information and even thoughts will massively increase the likelihood that others do as well. Being open with what is happening and keeping the channels of communication going will show that it is not just what people are being told to do but what is the way that things will be done as well. &quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot; isn&#39;t a phrase that helps in this situation.</p>

<p>There is a challenge that it must feel natural as forced sharing will often come across like that so allowing each manager to find their own path to this will help with the longevity of it and the acceptance from others. If sets of blogs and communications from the management team feels the same then the suspicion will arise that they are all coming from comms and aren&#39;t real. Allowing different personalities to come through will encourage diversity across the staff as well.</p>

<h2>Learning programmes</h2>

<p>Now much as I love informal learning and learning by example from others, there is still absolutely a place for more formal programmes to help others learn and to encourage the sharing of knowledge. While there is a backlash for the use of brownbag lunch sessions (the feeling being that people should still be allowed a proper lunch break too), the benefit of having sessions where you share knowledge and understanding and have the opportunity to see what others are doing really help to build that understanding across different areas and to allow for new ideas to pr`opogate out.</p>

<p>My first fulltime job was in a graduate role and the sessions where we were introduced to what others across the organisation did really opened up my eyes. It allowed me later to see the true benefit in SharePoint across everyone because I could have discussions with different areas about their needs with a good initial understanding of what they did. This isn&#39;t just about technology or the specific knowledge associated with different areas of a business but understanding how things are done in different areas. Do they have projects or just get things done? How does each department interact with others internally as well as with other departments. All this knowledge can help when shared.</p>

<h2>Break the organisation hierarchy</h2>

<p>I am not talking about starting civil unrest in the canteen at breakfast but encouraging communities of interest and purpose to be able to work together regardless of which department they sit in. Agile techniques can work across operations, HR, engineering, finance and IT so people with interest in that should work together to share what works for them, new ideas for being more productive and efficient and ways of doing things.</p>

<p>The sharing of knowledge through communities is a great indication of the ability of an organisation to be agile as it encourages the more matrix approach and ability to flex to challenges and opportunities that are faced. <a href="https://thearmyleader.co.uk/team-of-teams/">Team of Teams by General McChrystal</a> highlights the benefits of smaller cross-functional teams and for those to function well, using the knowledge shared between different teams in the required skills. By being able to move people into different areas, you can help the understanding of different areas and build that culture of sharing.</p>

<h2>Make it easy</h2>

<p>The last advice is to make it easy for people to share, help people fall into the right buckets. If they have hoops of approvals to go through to get knowledge out to others and it takes time that people rarely have then people won&#39;t do it. The natural inclination is to make sure that people capture all the information and metadata needed but this should be kept as easy as possible to do.</p>

<p>How do you make it easy? Using simple forms with as much filled in automatically as possible. Use context to provide the information rather than requiring people to do it themselves. Look at how modern AI tools can help automatically pull knowledge from existing areas (yup, I&#39;ll mention <a href="https://aka.ms/projectcortex">Project Cortex</a> at this point too, it&#39;s been a while). Create easy to use tools that work within tools that people are using already like Microsoft Teams. Allow people to do what they were doing before but with that knowledge being stored too.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>It is not an easy task to change the direction of an organisation and to build a new culture, however big the organisation is. It takes not only time but the enthusiasm and desire to make that change from all involved. However, for knowledge management initiatives to succeed, it is key that people are central to it and that they are encouraged and supported along the way to help it happen.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-09-26T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Microsoft Ignite 2020 (Sep 22-24) came more Knowledge Management news and the biggest one of these (at least as far as most people were concerned) was the first widely available service from Project Cortex. Rather than release one big service to organisations, Microsoft has listened to feedback and will be releasing different services under the Project Cortex banner and from October 1, you will be able to add SharePoint Syntex to your E3 and E5 licenses - but what is it?</p>

<blockquote><p>This is part five of the Knowledge Management series. For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href="/2020/08/12/knowledge-management-series">Part One - Introduction</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/10/knowledge-management-series-considering-where-knowledge-is-stored">Part Two - Considering where knowledge is stored</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/14/knowledge-management-organising-knowledge">Part Three - Organising knowledge</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/17/knowledge-management-series-creating-a-culture-of-knowledge">Part Four - Creating a culture of knowledge</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<h2>What is SharePoint Syntex?</h2>

<p>After the hints and suggestions around <a href="https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex">Project Cortex</a>, at <a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com">Ignite</a> there was details on what people would actually be able to do. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jeffteper">Jeff Teper</a> announced that it wouldn&#39;t just be about the single service but people would be able to pick the services that they wanted and the first available would be SharePoint Syntex, from October 1. This first service would be focused on automating the process of getting your metadata out of your SharePoint content using <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/machine-teaching/">Machine Teaching</a>. This is slightly difference to machine learning in that you can gather intelligence using a smaller set than you would use in machine learning and use experts to provide guidance, reducing the size of initial data set that would be required.</p>

<p>Syntex is suggested as being used in three areas:</p>

<ul><li>Content Understanding - extracting metadata from documents and setting classification automatically</li><li>Content Processing - categorise content and build in to automated processes</li><li>Content Governance - manage to content to apply appropriate security and governance</li></ul>

<p>Using a set of models, you can teach Syntex how to process different types of documents to automatically extract the metadata in three key ways (more on these later in this post):</p>

<ul><li>Document understanding - recognise patterns in documents such as resumes, statements of work and contracts to extract key info</li><li>Form processing - using AI Builder, extracting information from images and other document forms that are structured or semi-structured such as printed contracts or feedback forms</li><li>Digital image processing - automatic tagging of images by recognising the content and extracting handwritten content from images</li></ul>

<p>Syntex also appears to be wrapping in some of the Microsoft Search capabilities with Graph Connectors so that you can pull content outside of SharePoint and OneDrive into this as well. For larger organisations who have invested in other ways to store their knowledge such as ServiceNow or even MediaWiki. From what I can tell at this stage, this means that you don&#39;t need to first mgirate your content into SharePoint/OneDrive to get your metadata, you can also connect it at source which fits with my earlier post of finding <a href="/2020-09-10-Knowledge-Management-Series-Considering-where-knowledge-is-stored.html">where knowledge is stored</a> and <a href="/2020-09-14-Knowledge-Management-Series-Organising-knowledge.html">organising that knowledge</a> without having to move it.</p>

<p>The final area is for me one of the most interesting and that is the extension to the recent Content Services in SharePoint that will allow administrators to see how the metadata is being used. This has been an area lacking in SharePoint for a long time with Administrators spending plenty of time structuring their metadata but having no idea if it was being used in the right way without using a third party tool or some heavy scripting. Making this available and consumable will open up a far more analytically driven management of the metadata and understanding the depth to which people are assigning content. For example, do people tag content with HR or Human Resources as a department, do they just tag everything as Public rather than Internal or Confidential, etc. It will also look at widely used Enterprise Keywords (an open set of metadata with little governance) to see commonly used terms that probably should move to a more governed set of metadata. This will also include management of Content Types to Hub Sites to help push out standard content types more easily - I truly hope that this works better than the current Content Type Hub!</p>

<h2>Document Understanding</h2>

<p>There are several third party tools that have added capabilities for tagging metadata available but this is the first from Microsoft. Some of those tools have used Azure and the AI capabilities in Cognitive Services but not Microsoft has wrapped these up into their own tools. The Document Understanding allows licensed users to take a sample set of documents and process them by:</p>

<ul><li>Identifying a Content Type to hold the metadata</li><li>Teach the model what should match this Content Type using at least five different documents</li><li>Train the model to extract entities using phrases, positions and others</li><li>Match the model to labels</li><li>Assign to Content Type Hubs</li></ul>

<p>You can watch a great <a href="https://aka.ms/SharePointSyntex/demo">Click through demo</a> of this which gives an idea of how it works. I was lucky enough to see an early preview of this late last year and at the time, felt that it was a little hard to just get going with it - it felt like it would involve a lot of training to get started. However, Microsoft have really learnt from the early previews and this demo shows that it is easy to pick up common patterns. I look forward to being able to trying this out with some real content like our requirements docs and statements of work that can make it easier to match the content. Imagine being able to load all your project definitions into one place and then have the document be tagged with the Project Name, department and key stakeholders so that it shows up in the project site, department site and makes it easy for stakeholders to see all their definitions. It could even track common themes in the project so you could see all Finance projects, C# projects, customer projects, etc in one place. The models created can be re-used as well and published to other libraries as well so they can be duplicated across areas for common patterns.</p>

<p><img alt="Syntex Extractor Example" src="020/09/SyntexExtractorExample.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Form Processing</h2>

<p>For those who follow the Power Platform, you will likely already know about AI Builder and what could be done to process images of forms and cards to extract entities automatically. I have even used this with my son in a Power App to take photos of Pokemon cards and extract all the stats for each. This logic could be used to process tickets or physical ID cards quickly and easily. This has been integrated into SharePoint for a while but had multiple hoops with licensing and connecting to metadata. With Syntex, this can now all be done for you in one go. It will be interesting to see how much this gets above the standard AI Builder over time.</p>

<p><img alt="Form Processor Example" src="020/09/FormProcessorExample.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Digital Image Processing</h2>

<p>Similar to Form Processing, this seems to be similar to functionality to what is already available. Text and handwriting are extracted from image files and indexed already and you can get a recommended alt text for uploaded photos. Syntex takes this further in that you can set your own fields with these values and get more control over how it is used.</p>

<h2>What is new?</h2>

<p>There were certainly some people who were disappointed with Syntex, hoping for more to be announced around the knowledge hubs and new information as well. I personally think we&#39;ll see those pretty soon and certainly before the end of the year but let me quickly what I cover exactly what is new:</p>

<ul><li>Document understanding really builds on the Azure Cognitive Services to make it easy to apply models - yes, you could develop your own in Azure but this makes it easy for end users to understand and use.</li><li>Compliance and security are closely linked in to all of this so you can add more intelligence to your labelling processes.</li><li>Bringing it all together into one place and integrating the services, making it easier to get less technical users to make the most of the services available.</li><li>Analytics on how the content is actually being used, allowing people to act on real data not just hunches.</li></ul>

<p>You can read more about the details in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/project-cortex-blog/announcing-sharepoint-syntex/ba-p/1681139">announcement blog</a> on SharePoint Syntex.</p>

<p>Will these new capabilities and ease of use for existing services be worthwhile? Much will depend on the final details on the licensing to be announced on October 1. Microsoft have said that Syntex will be an add-on to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans">E3/E5 licenses</a> but I have not yet seen how many license you will need, i.e. will it require everyone in an organisation to be licensed or just those creating models? October will reveal all but I would hope that it will just be a smaller subset of power users who need to be licensed. How much? <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-sharepoint-syntex-to-automate-content-categorization-and-build-a-foundation-for-knowledge-curation/">ZDNet think</a> that it will be $5 per user per month which I think sounds a great amount for those power users to set content. If it&#39;s for all who view the content then that could be a harder sell to most organisations.</p>

<h2>What is next?</h2>

<p>We have <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/project-cortex-blog/announcing-sharepoint-syntex/ba-p/1681139">already been told</a> that this is the first service in Project Cortex and that more will be generally available by the end of the year but what will those other services be? There have been details of Knowledge Hub sites that act as a landing page for knowledge on specific entities such as projects in an organisation as can be seen in <a href="https://demobuilderwebcpptxz.blob.core.windows.net/microsoft-365-knowledge-sharing/startdemo.html?ot=false&amp;lan=&amp;guidemodeenabled=false&amp;audioenabled=false">this demo</a>. In addition, Project Cortex has talked about having knowledge experts who will be able to define specific knowledge on top of the automatically tagged info. There is also many comments about Cortex being the join of People and AI to ensure that it is useful and relevant to what people need.</p>

<p>I would like to see more around the use of Bots to surface Knowledge automatically to people that is relevant at the right time and based on what they are doing, especially with a greater integration to Microsoft Teams which is now the hub for most people doing work. It would also be interesting to see whether taxonomies can start to be recommended rather than just being defined by experts up front.</p>

<p>What is coming on October 1 looks very useful and the positioning of a set of services feels like a great approach to open this up to more people. I&#39;ll confess to being slightly disappointed that more wasn&#39;t released yet but will hold on to that for the end of the year!</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-09-30T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has been speaking for some time about the power of Microsoft Search and the ability to have one place to search for all your content. This has gradually been coming more and more true but one of the areas that has not been widely available has been the ability to add your own custom content to the index. However, that is now possible and allows developers to bring content into search alongside other content. In this post, I will run through two ways of doing this but both will require development experience, including a sample from the graph team and then my own example using Logic Apps to consume Twitter content.</p>

<h2>Overview of custom connectors</h2>

<p>Microsoft Search has the ability to connect to standard systems through the Microsoft 365 Admin Centre for some standard systems including SQL Server, Azure Dev Ops, MediaWiki and the others mentioned in the image below. These allow users to follow a wizard guide to enable content to be added to the index so where you have data in SQL such as a table of custom application data, this can be added to your Microsoft Search.</p>

<p>However, if you have a third party application or content in something like Cosmos DB, you need to use the interfaces in Microsoft Graph to add content to the index. This broadens the capabilities to connect without having to first move data to one of the systems below.</p>

<p><img alt="Current Search Connectors" src="/images/2020/09/DefaultSearchConnectors.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Adding custom data with .Net Core</h2>

<p>The easiest point to get started with the custom search connectors is to use the <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample">sample code</a> from the Microsoft Graph team. This has a great guide in the readme to get started using a console app to connect. The process that it follows is:</p>

<ul><li>Set up the app registration in Azure AD</li><li>Grant permissions for External Items to have Read/Write</li><li>Create an External Connection giving a unique ID, name and description</li><li>Create a schema for the index content and assign to the connection</li><li>Add items to the index</li><li>Confirm connection set up in Microsoft 365 Admin Centre</li><li>Create a Vertical at the tenant or site level</li><li>Create a Result Source for the layout of the results (using https://searchlayoutdesigner.azurewebsites.net/)</li></ul>

<p>Once these are set up (following the great <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> in the sample), the results show up in the main search results as a vertical below where the sample Parts vertical is set up. The console app sets up each of the steps above through number prompts for the user but is designed as an example not as a real solution to use. Which brings me to using Logic Apps.</p>

<p><img alt="Parts Search Results" src="/images/2020/09/PartsSearchResults.png"/></p>

<h2>Pulling index results using Logic Apps</h2>

<p>Taking the ideas in the repo above to a more usable setting, I decided that pulling a set of tweets from Twitter would be useful to be searchable across Microsoft 365, using the great information that gets shared regularly on the TweetJam&#39;s run by <a href="https://twitter.com/@buckleyplanet">Christian Buckley</a> under the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23collabtalk&amp;src=typed_query">#CollabTalk</a> hashtag. There are some great conversations that take place and useful information shared and making this available within the help guides could be useful.</p>

<p>The use of Logic Apps meant control over how the ingestion of the indexes can be triggered. Rather than the historic way of running nightly imports, the trigger can happen straight away and have the content made available. They also provide an easy way of viewing the history of imports both through the run history and through easy integration with App Insights.</p>

<p>So what Logic Apps are created? All the Logic Apps are available in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector">Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector repo</a>.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector/blob/main/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnectorSetup.json">Setup</a> - configures the connection and required schema, more on this below.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector/blob/main/Mcd79TwitterSearchCollabTalk.json">Search</a> - Retrieves up to 99 tweets to pull a range of information.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector/blob/main/Mcd79Twitter-CollabTalk.json">Trigger</a> - Regular trigger for any new tweets with the hashtag.</li></ul>

<p>The first Logic App creates a connection with unique ID, name and description to identify the index items. It checks first to see if it exists and adds it if not. The same then follows for the schema which outlines the model for the index and defines which properties can be held. This is a relatively simple schema with datatypes but no collections or sub-schemas available.</p>

<p><img alt="Setup Logic App" src="/images/2020/09/SetupConnectorAndSchema.jpg"/></p>

<p>The schema itself defines the properties to be captured with the name and type as well as four other values from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/schema?view=graph-rest-beta">schema definition</a>:</p>

<ul><li>isQueryable - whether the property can be used in search queries using KQL</li><li>isRefinable - whether the property can be used to refine the query with filters</li><li>isRetrievable - whether the property can be returned in the search results</li><li>isSearchable - whether the property is searchable</li></ul>

<p>The schema that I created for the Tweets can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/Mcd79TwitterSearchConnector/blob/main/schema.json">the repo</a>.</p>

<p>In both the search and trigger Logic Apps, the key element is the part that creates the index. This is done by making a PUT request against the connection and using a unique ID for each index. In the tweets case, I am using the Tweet ID. The body of the PUT request includes four key areas:</p>

<ul><li>Type - the type of object, usually microsoft.graph.externalItem</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/acl?view=graph-rest-beta">ACL</a> - the security required on the index item which can be a user, group, everyone or everyoneExceptGuests.</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalitemcontent?view=graph-rest-beta">Content</a> - the text content of the index, in the tweet it is the tweet contents.</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalitem?view=graph-rest-beta">Properties</a> - JSON object that must meet the schema defined</li></ul>

<p>You can create up to 2,000,000 indexes in your tenant across both the custom connector and the standard connectors. Once you have added the index, you can follow the same guide as in the search sample <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> to set up the Verticals and the Result Source to show how it will be rendered.</p>

<p>Once done, you can see the results appear in your search results as below.</p>

<p><img alt="Tweet Search Results" src="/images/2020/09/TweetSearchResults.jpg"/></p>

<p>So there you have it, the content from CollabTalk appearing right there in your search results. Obviously, I have picked this as an example but that content could be from your custom applications, Salesforce and anyone one of the many other Connectors that exists in Logic Apps. The only struggle I had was about getting the Graph Auth in place (I originally tried using Managed Identity as in <a href="https://garrytrinder.github.io/2020/09/implement-microsoft-graph-app-only-calls-the-easy-way-using-azure-logic-apps-and-azure-managed-identity">Garry Trinder&#39;s great post</a> on using it with Logic Apps but found issues that I&#39;ll look back at) but otherwise, it was set up in an hour.</p>

<p>While this is a developer task and not through a wizard, it is an easy way to extend your search results and get access to data where you need it and render how it appears.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-12-06T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, myself and my fellow co-hosts of GreyHatBeard were joined by Luise Freese, Vesa Nopanen and Karoliina Kettukari at Collab Days Munich/Vienna as we shared our thoughts on the etiquette of Microsoft 365. It was a fun format with plenty of chance to laugh at the same time as attendees picking up some great ideas as we ran through three questions that each person had 90 seconds to answer.</p>

<ul><li>What breach of good etiquette most frustrates you in Microsoft 365?</li><li>What do you wish Microsoft 365 would do to encourage good etiquette?</li><li>What is your top tip for tip top Microsoft 365 etiquette?</li></ul>

<p>So what did our etiquette experts recommend?</p>

<h2>What breach of good etiquette most frustrates you in Microsoft 365?</h2>

<h3>Al</h3>

<p>People booking meetings without checking the scheduling assistant to check if I have time available for the meeting. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/video-use-the-scheduling-assistant-a7bf1aee-bee6-46d6-a126-194ed04fbe09">this video</a> for an example on how to do it.</p>

<h3>Luise</h3>

<p>Saying &quot;hello&quot; and then writing nothing but forcing me to ask &quot;whats up&quot;. You disrupt people from what they are doing and force them to wait. Instead say hello and what you are after in one post. For a great link explaining this, see [https://sbmueller.github.io/nohello/.</p>

<p>Also, when people keep with old working habits in new tools: cascading folders, signatures in chats, adding people to a chat to cover your ass. There&#39;s no need!</p>

<h3>Vesa</h3>

<p>Not showing up on time for Teams meetings or having to leave in the middle of the meeting without telling the schedule issues in advance. The worst is when people show up late and then ask for the full review of things missed, shouting out a few quick opinions and then leaving.
Also, when using Microsoft 365, don&#39;t make all content personal. Instead of files on OneDrive, make use of SharePoint. Instead of personal flows and personal Power Apps, make them team flows and shared apps. Start as you mean to go on, all the way from draft.</p>

<h3>Karoliina</h3>

<p>When people are complaining about notifications, teams and channels but not caring to go through the settings to configure them. There are settings that can be configured with a bit of time.</p>

<p>In fact, even further, complaining about everything but not caring to learn how to use the tool properly. There are so many ways to learn how to do things that you should investigate.</p>

<h3>Garry</h3>

<p>Not using subject lines for new conversations. These help introduce a subject and give people a summary.</p>

<p>Also, ignoring presence status - do not disturb is not I&#39;m available and those chats coming in will break someone&#39;s focus.</p>

<h2>What do you wish Microsoft 365 would do to encourage good etiquette?</h2>

<h3>Vesa</h3>

<p>Analyzing the agenda and not letting someone send the invitation until agenda is properly filled if there are more than 10 people invited.</p>

<p>Marking a meeting &quot;cameras will be on&quot; and turning off such a meeting cameras on automatically.</p>

<p>Reminding people putting documents to silos/hidden areas such as OneDrive that &quot;this seems to be a document that would be better to be saved to a shared location&quot;.</p>

<p>Bring back Clippy as a Microsoft 365 version and annoy people until they comply!</p>

<h3>Al</h3>

<p>When sharing a screen on Teams put a message up with the name of a person who has put their hand up and allowing me to click it so their hand is lowered.</p>

<p>Put the names of people with hands up in order so I know who put their hand up first and can allow them to ask their question first.</p>

<h3>Garry</h3>

<p>Allow setting of default messages for presence statuses. For example, you could suggest alternative contact methods.</p>

<p>Letting people automatically know when you are next free based on your calendar, e.g. &quot;Garry is busy right now but will become available at 14:00?&quot;</p>

<h3>Luise</h3>

<p>Mute – raise hand – unmute. Please, dear Microsoft Teams, help people to lower their hands when they have made their point. EVERYONE forgets to lower their hands!</p>

<h3>Karoliina</h3>

<p>Smart tooltips when writing a message or making a calendar invite (like you get in Outlook).</p>

<p>Suggestions to make a team instead or to discuss in an existing team when you create a groupchat with the same people. Also suggesting NOT to mention a whole team or a channel.</p>

<h2>What is your top tip for tip top Microsoft 365 etiquette?</h2>

<h3>Karoliina</h3>

<p>Teams is for teamwork &amp; sharing is caring &amp; all that glitters are unicorns.</p>

<p>Learn to use the tools together with your team as working together will help that combined understanding.</p>

<h3>Al</h3>

<p>Use scheduling assistant to ensure people are free and if you cannot find a time when everyone is free, use FindTime to offer options to all attendees.</p>

<p>Make sure that you respond to meeting invites and add messages to responses. Just leaving things hanging leaves people unclear on what is going to happen.</p>

<h3>Vesa</h3>

<p>Respect others – don&#39;t take over the meeting. Keep your mic off unless you speak. Keep the camera on and pay attention to the meeting (don&#39;t multitask – I am guilty on this one).
In Microsoft 365, work together, put files and apps already in version 0.1 to a shared location. This can make it clear that it is in draft but is available for viewing straight away.</p>

<h3>Luise</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t let people jump from meeting to meeting. Schedule meetings that everyone can take a break, especially in this current world where everyone is at home.</p>

<h3>Garry</h3>

<p>Use Subject lines in conversations, you can search messages by subject line in Teams and it makes them more discoverable.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just throw documents into Files and expect people to know that they are there. Follow up your upload with a post in the chat area to let people know that are there. For imporant documents start a new conversation with subject line and shared file, this helps discoverability of the document and also a good starting point for document conversations.</p>

<p>Share the way you work in email footers and your status message and encourage others to do the same to set expectations for how they expect you to engage.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>We all had a great time during the session, despite my buzzer adding that frisson to the atmosphere. Vesa and Luise won through to the final where they had to defend the indefensible, showing their ability to justify things that probably shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<ul><li>Luise - What we need is a new service for tracking tasks in Microsoft 365</li><li>Vesa - Agendas in meeting invites are a waste of time</li></ul>

<p>Both were very articulate and had me persuaded that they were great ideas (outrageous!) but Vesa just managed to take the win by mentioning whiskey!</p>

<p>I would like to give my heart felt thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/LuiseFreese">Luise</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vesanopanen">Vesa</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kettukari">Karoliina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytrinder">Garry</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/al_eardley">Al</a> for all their great tips and for being so entertaining with them. If you would like to hear more of these events, let user group and conference organisers know and we&#39;ll see what we can do!</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2020-12-09T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hit a strange issue this week but today had that massive buzz of solving it. Sometimes it is the simple things that you&#39;ve missed but other times (like this one), it is something very odd. The problem was that I had a set of around 1000 migrated sites that had come from SharePoint 2010 and should have been set up as Modern sites. They appeared to be but the SharePoint Groups had retained the old names, i.e.</p>

<ul><li>Site Owners</li><li>Site Members</li><li>Site Visitors</li></ul>

<p>I was expecting the groups to have the name of the site in there, i.e. if my site was called &quot;My New Site&quot; then the groups would be:</p>

<ul><li>My New Site Owners</li><li>My New Site Members</li><li>My New Site Visitors</li></ul>

<p>As I was investigating, I noticed that some of the sites had started to get the new names. At this point, I thought I was going mad but as I had taken notes, I knew that something had changed and it wasn&#39;t just my goldfish level memory. I eventually realised that if I browsed to Site Permissions from a Modern Home page then something happened along the way that triggered the correction.</p>

<p>My next step was to check PnP PowerShell to see if the sites needed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/features/groupify/groupify-overview">Groupifying</a> but running the command <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/add-pnpmicrosoft365grouptosite?view=sharepoint-ps">Add-PnPMicrosoft365GroupToSite</a> told me that they were already associated with a Group.</p>

<p>Finally, I got developer-y and opened up the Chredge Dev Console to look at which REST calls the page made when it hit the Site Permissions page. This is when I discovered a POST call to /_api/GroupService/SyncGroupProperties and this sounded promising. I fired up <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/invoke-pnpsprestmethod?view=sharepoint-ps">Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod</a> and made a call to a site that happened been manually fixed yet and by magic, it worked! This certainly saved a very dull day of manually clicking several hundred site permission links.</p>

<p>I should say that I cannot find this API documented anywhere so this does not appear to be a fully supported API but if this post saves someone a day or several days of clicking on sites then I&#39;ll be a happy person.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2021-01-16T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back, I was lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to try out the Lenovo ThinkSmart View, a standalone device dedicated to Microsoft Teams. Many of you may be thinking &quot;erm, why would you want that?&quot; and the simple answer (which I&#39;ll expand on in a minute) is performance. Too many times has Teams rendered my machine unusable and I spend a large chunk of my day in meetings. Would this improve my experience?</p>

<p>In this post, I&#39;ll cover what the device is, why you might need it, a run through of the set up, initial thoughts, longer term and then a wrap up.</p>

<h2>What is the Lenovo ThinkSmart View</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s start with what the device is. It&#39;s an Android powered device with an 8&quot; LCD, with a camera, speaker and microphone that allows you to offload the running of Teams to a separate device. It has a separate power supply and can run entirely independently of your PC but can also synch up so that you can still share screen on your PC even though the meeting is running on your device.</p>

<p>Overall, it is a great looking piece of kit that feels solid with a silky smooth surface and very stable when in either landscape or portrait mode. It includes a manual camera shutter so you can ensure that you are not being watched. For me, the speakerphone capability was hugely useful and like having a conference phone on your desk but you can also connect with bluetooth headsets if you are in a more exposed area like an open plan office.</p>

<p>You can see full details on the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/smart-devices/smart-office/thinksmart/Lenovo-CD-18781/p/ZZISZSCCD03">Lenovo site</a>.</p>

<h2>Why would you need it?</h2>

<p>For me, the reason I was looking for a device like this was that my Surface Pro 6 often slows down massively when on Teams calls. I will admit that I am a tab hoarder and often have multiple profiles open in the new Edge but the amount of memory that Teams takes up for a call with a number of people on is huge. Too often, I was unable to do things on my PC during a meeting, hugely limiting my productivity.</p>

<p>I also like to have Teams front and centre and having a dedicated device showing a summary of my day and with easy access to chat was something I am keen on. Having a single screen showing your upcoming events while you are working on a document and comparing with a webpage means that you do not miss things coming up, especially if you are focusing and don&#39;t want notifications.</p>

<p>Finally, it is a good quality speakerphone meaning that you don&#39;t have to be wearing headphones in meetings all day. Being constricted for long hours really adds to the drain of remote working constantly.</p>

<h2>What was the setup experience like?</h2>

<p>I will be honest that my initial impressions were hugely underwhelming. It only had meetings and calls available and felt very limited. This was surprising and not what I had expected from one of the Teams devices.</p>

<p>Thankfully, after a little digging, I found <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-microsoft-teams-displays/ba-p/1505437">this article</a> on Teams Devices and confirmed that it had not been set up as a Teams Device. I logged it into my tenant and then went into the Teams Admin area - if you don&#39;t have access to the Teams Admin area, make sure you know someone who is as this is essential to support the device.</p>

<p>From Teams Admin, I could now upgrade to the latest version and also set it as a Teams Device. It took a few tries at doing this and I found it worked best by making it a scheduled update but later that evening, I finally had the device that I was expecting.</p>

<h2>Initial thoughts</h2>

<p>The interface feels very slick and navigating takes place quickly. As well as having meetings and making calls, you have the ability to access the Teams Hub and can chat with people too. Chat can either be done on the touch screen or you can connect up to your PC and so use your PC keyboard. It&#39;s simple to understand and move between the different features and feels natural doing it.</p>

<p>An interesting area is how it interacts with your PC as well. When sharing screen, you can still connect with the PC client and share your screen from there but as it is not running the video, it uses less RAM there (one of the big reasons I wanted a separate device). It connected simply and worked well, giving that seamless experience.</p>

<p>What about the meeting sound and vision? The quality of the camera is very average and the angle of the device means that you are going to be getting that view of any chins that you have been hoarding during lockdown which isn&#39;t ideal. From the perspective of the person with the device, the audio is just right as a speakerphone but I did hear some comments about the volume of typing on the keyboard so you may need to make liberal use of the mute. The background blur also causes problems and stops the camera working at all in many cases so I decided against using that.</p>

<p>The biggest missing feature I found was tasks as would love to be able to pin my ToDos on the screen as a reminder of what to do that day alongside the calendar itself. Hopefully something that will come soon.</p>

<h2>Longer term</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve now been using the device for a couple of months with the comments above being for the first few days of usage. What are my thoughts now?</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;ve started using the device less and less. It&#39;s nice to have there for my quick view of upcoming meetings but the quality of the video and audio became more of an issue. I like to be looking at people for meetings and having that separate device when I had content on screen gave off the view that I wasn&#39;t watching too much. The smaller screen was also hard to look at other people&#39;s content and I found myself having to move closer to see, giving people a lovely view of my forehead and not much else.</p>

<p>The link with the PC that I lauded at first soon became less stable and would often not be there, leading me to have to join the meeting twice. This would use just as much RAM on the PC and completely removed the point I was trying to overcome. I would also run Teams as typing on the device was so slow and clunkier than on a phone due to where it was and the angle. Which brings me to the one point that could start me using the device again more.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the Cortana integration is only available in the US as a preview. To have a standalone device that I could ask when my next meeting was or what tasks I had left to do that day would definitely interest me. Would it work well? I don&#39;t know as I couldn&#39;t find anyway to enable it at all here in the UK. Hopefully this preview will reach a bit further and open up more of that voice control which is great in a home office with no-one to disturb. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So, the big question - would I recommend this device?</p>

<p>This is a really tricky one. It&#39;s great looking and I enjoyed using it - having that extra screen to see your chats, upcoming meetings and unread Teams messages is nice. Being able to not to have to use headphones and still get a clear sound was great as I have definitely been feeling distant from having headphones on all day long.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s an expensive device just for these things. What would make it worthwhile is to be able to offload the full use of Teams from the PC and reduce that memory utilisation. For me, it just doesn&#39;t quite do this. The video quality isn&#39;t good enough and I don&#39;t want that up angle nose shot too much. The sharing of the desktop PC screen is too inconsistent.</p>

<p>The use of Cortana may tip things back into the firm recommend option but at the moment, I can&#39;t quite justify the cost for what it offers to others. I will be keeping it on my desk for now and keep an eye out for those Cortana updates.</p>

        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2021-02-06T10:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Autumn came and went. Christmas and the end of the year came and went. 2021 started but still there was no sign of Project Cortex. Vaccines appeared and hope for an end to the pandemic being in sight. But still no Cortex. No knowledge hubs. What could be wrong? Were there problems? Would we see it happen. Now we know the answer and the answer is Microsoft Viva. And I like it.</p>

<p>This post will introduce Viva and especially Viva Topics, talking about what it is, how you can set it up and my thoughts on using it so far.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is part six of the Knowledge Management series. For other parts, see links below:</p><ul><li><a href="/2020/08/12/knowledge-management-series">Part One - Introduction</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/10/knowledge-management-series-considering-where-knowledge-is-stored">Part Two - Considering where knowledge is stored</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/14/knowledge-management-organising-knowledge">Part Three - Organising knowledge</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/17/knowledge-management-series-creating-a-culture-of-knowledge">Part Four - Creating a culture of knowledge</a></li><li><a href="/2020/09/26/knowledge-management-series-introduction-to-sharepoint-syntex">Part Five - An introduction to SharePoint Syntex</a></li></ul></blockquote>

<h2>What is Microsoft Viva?</h2>

<p>Before I describe Viva Topics, I should cover what Microsoft Viva is but there are two answers to this:</p>

<ul><li>For the vast majority of people, it is an Employee Experience Platform (EXP) that puts in place everything an employee will need from being onboarded, getting the latest information and learning key knowledge for your role.</li><li>For those that follow Microsoft 365 closely, it can appear as a collection of announcements that had already been made given a flashy new name.</li></ul>

<p>The reality is a bit of both. The services <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/overview">announced by Satya Nadella</a> had mostly been mentioned before but the beauty of Viva is the simplicty of the messaging. It is not about the underlying technology (impressive as that is) but what it enables for employees and the consistency that it should bring about. Thankfully, someone who can explain this far more eloquently than me has already done so I highly recommend <a href="https://joshbersin.com/2021/02/the-massive-market-impact-of-microsoft-viva/?utm_sq=gnc2jj2w0o">Josh Bersin&#39;s article</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/02/04/microsoft-viva-empowering-every-employee-for-the-new-digital-age/">four pillars</a> that form Viva with Viva Connections, Viva Learning, Viva Insights and Viva Topics - today, I&#39;ll be focusing on the last pillar.</p>

<h2>What is Viva Topics?</h2>

<p>If you have been following my <a href="/2020/09/03/Knowledge-Management-Series.html">Knowledge Management Series</a>, you will know that I have been excited about Project Cortex and what it was going to offer. <a href="/2020/09/26/Knowledge-Management-Series-Introduction-to-SharePoint-Syntex.html">SharePoint Syntex</a> whet my appetite with some AI goodness but the knowledge hubs that I saw were really what I wanted. The ability to easily share common phrases and have those be easily linked to from across Microsoft 365 were something that would truly enable the sharing of topics. Viva Topics is the released name for exactly that.</p>

<p>On setup, you are given a Topic Centre where you can curate the topics to be shared. Each topic has its own page where you can describe the topic, add experts, related files and pages and then other linked topics. Simply, it&#39;s the central place to find information on that topic.</p>

<p>Could it just be a standard page? Yeah, it probably could be. But Topics will become much more. They will soon start showing up in other Microsoft 365 services, starting with SharePoint, where any point that the topic is written will show as a link back to that hub. Sadly, this isn&#39;t in place yet but will start rolling out through the year.</p>

<h2>Getting started with Viva Topics</h2>

<p>One of the things that I have heard a few times just after the announcement was that it was not obvious how to get started. I put this up quickly on Twitter in a <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk/status/1357377802320949248?s=20">TweetStream</a> but to keep things easier to find, here are the steps to take.</p>

<h4>Get a license (or trial license)</h4>

<p>The quick link is to go to <a href="https://aka.ms/BuyVivaTopics">the request page from Microsoft</a>. Otherwise, from the <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal">Microsoft 365 Admin Centre</a>:</p>

<ul><li>Click on Billing then Purchase Services</li><li>Click on View Products</li><li>Scroll to Add-Ons and click on Show All</li><li>Select Topics and Start Trial or add a license</li></ul>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nzvVCEVCXY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<h4>Assign license to yourself and others who need it</h4>

<p>When you have the licenses:</p>

<ul><li>Head to the Admin Centre home page</li><li>Click on Users then Active Users</li><li>Select the user to get the license</li><li>Click on the &quot;Licensing and Apps&quot; tab</li><li>Select the &quot;Topic Experiences&quot; license</li><li>Click on Save</li></ul>

<h4>Set up Topics</h4>

<p>Once you have at least one license assigned to yourself, return to the Admin Centre and select Setup from the menu.</p>

<ul><li>Scroll down to Files and Content</li><li>Click on the &quot;Connect People to knowledge&quot; link</li><li>Follow the wizard with your preferred set up</li><li>Wait a few mins for it to complete</li></ul>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOMGm6z98Gk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<p>Since I put the video together, <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigHumphrey">Craig Humphrey</a> (apologies if it was a different Craig!) noted via the Microsoft 365 Partner Network that you can also:</p>

<ul><li>Head to the Admin Centre home page</li><li>Click Settings then Org Settings</li><li>On the Services tab, scroll down to Topic Experiences</li></ul>

<h4>Starting to create topics</h4>

<p>As part of the setup wizard, you will be asked to create a Topic Centre which by default is at /sites/TopicCentre. If you forget where it&#39;s created, you can also navigate from the Settings-&gt;Org Settings-&gt;Topic Experiences mentioned just above.</p>

<p>In the new Topic Centre, there is an easy link to add a new Topic Page as well as a Getting Started tab that points you to three useful links:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/your-knowledge-network-in-microsoft-365-53620e12-ae00-4523-87cf-e935ae77d541?ns=spostandard&amp;version=16&amp;syslcid=1033&amp;uilcid=1033&amp;appver=spo160&amp;helpid=csi_topiccenter_getstarted_intro&amp;ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us">Intro to Knowledge Network</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/knowledge/topic-experiences-discovery-curation">Understanding topic discovery</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/knowledge/manage-topics">Manage Topics</a></li></ul>

<p>As you can see in the video below, creating a Topic Page is easy. You add a title, descriptions, some key people who are the experts, key pages and documents and finally how the topic links to other topics in a beautiful graph style chart.</p>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvmbYruNBLA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<h2>Topics - a few thoughts</h2>

<p>I have only been trying this out for a few hours so far but I have a few initial thoughts, positive and negative.</p>

<h4>The good parts</h4>

<p>Getting started is easy. In a few minutes, I had a Topic Centre and it only took five minutes to create a set of topics. I started with Power Platform and easily created linked topics for Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents. From our demo environment, I had some samples that I also created topics for and linked to those demo pages.</p>

<p>The Topic Centre neatly displays all those Topics that you have created with summary cards for each, showing recent activity and whether it is a curated Topic (i.e. defined by a person) or a discovered one (i.e. discovered by AI but not yet validated by a real person). The Topic Pages can be edited with your own web parts as well so they aren&#39;t fixed and can flex to what you need which is really useful.</p>

<p><img alt="The Topic Centre" src="/images/2021/02/Viva Topics Topic Centre.jpg"/></p>

<p>The other great part now available in topics is that they show up in Microsoft Search. No need to create a separate bookmark in Answers, it appears as a card already with the key people and resources shown by default and a link to the Topic Page</p>

<p><img alt="Topics in Search" src="/images/2021/02/Topics in Microsoft Search.jpg"/></p>

<h4>The potentially bad parts or hopefully just the &quot;not yet there parts&quot; (at least at the time of writing)</h4>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get carried away with these new technologies and become over excited with the good stuff so I always like to include a bit of a grumble. Often, these turn out to either be wrong or resolved pretty quickly. What has raised flags to be in Viva Topics:</p>

<ul><li>Creating links between Topics only seems to exist on a single page so far - I am hoping that this is just the suggestions not kicking in yet but I found it a bit frustrating.</li><li>It is not clear how Managed Metadata will play a part in this or even if it will - it would be good to understand whether to invest time in both or go down one path.</li><li>The highlighting of Topics on other pages and in emails that was talked about with Cortex is not there yet but <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/introducing-microsoft-viva-topics/ba-p/2107007">will be coming later this year</a>.</li><li>Something I want to see more of is the suggestions which don&#39;t really show up in a demo environment - hopefully I will be adding this to our main tenant at CPS soon and will see more coming through of value.</li><li>At the moment, there is no programmatic access to Topics, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevmcdonk/status/1357471161462980617?s=20">via Graph</a> or any other APIs - I suspect this will appear soon and with <a href="https://register.ignite.microsoft.com/">MS Ignite</a> on the horizon, there seems a good point for more to be shared.</li><li>You need to think about the licensing for this as it is an add-on but I am hoping to cover this in a future post.</li></ul>

<p>So the only bad points I have found so far appear to be things that will be addressed. Otherwise, this feels like a very powerful way to curate knowledge in an organisation and get that in front of people at the right time. The latter part is coming soon but that shouldn&#39;t stop you determining what your topics will be and moving those topics from Managed Metadata potentially.</p>

<p>I am planning a few more posts as I invest a bit more time to investigate a bit deeper so keep an eye out.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2021-03-21T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been a little quiet on this blog recently and while the stress of the pandemic with lots of kids at home has played into that, another large part has been a painful migration project. I have learnt plenty about the scales of SharePoint Online and reminding myself of the limitations of SharePoint 2010 - I really had forgotten how painful it was considering servers! One of the biggest areas though has been the validation. While the migration tooling gives us some information, we have been running lots of PnP PowerShell scripts for both creating structures and also validating that content has migrated correctly. Having tens of thousands of sites and libraries brings its own challenges.</p>

<p>This weekend I found a great improvement to things. Instead of just using PnP PowerShell, I decided to use REST calls and focus them on particular things. PnP PowerShell is fantastic but it does everything and there are often times where speed is the important factor, not scale. Reducing the amount of data returned and only returning what you need can have huge benefits.</p>

<p>One thing that hasn&#39;t changed is the use of a database to track what has run and what hasn&#39;t. Being able to re-run a script at any point and know that it will pick up where it left off has meant that the age old challenges of servers rebooting in the middle of the night mean there is less impact with being able to start again.</p>

<h2>So what does the script do?</h2>

<p>The script I was working on most recently was aimed at checking that everything was in place ready for handover. It checked a set of libraries for:</p>

<ul><li>Check library is hidden</li><li>Check Minor Versions disabled</li><li>Check search is disabled</li><li>Check title is set correctly</li><li>Check ContentTypes exist</li><li>Check default content type set</li><li>Check list specific field added to content types</li><li>Check fields set to correct required fields</li><li>Check field order set</li><li>Check views set</li></ul>

<p>You may wonder why some of these things are in there (a list specific field added to each content type?) but I&#39;ll save that chat for when we can meet for a coffee/beer/whisky. The challenges with some of these were that the migrated content was in a different state to what we wanted in a few cases which added to the fun.</p>

<h2>How did the original script work?</h2>

<p>For working with the database, I made use of a few scripts that you can find with a quick Google:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PowerShell/blob/master/Out-DataTable.ps1">out-table.ps1</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/suntong/lang/blob/e7bd7a35690ec89cadee39d21ebb8d921854534d/lang/PowerShell/Examples/Db/Write-DataTable.ps1">write-datatable.ps1</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/falkheiland/CommonTools/blob/dfcd4c5fc3b8703a19f72291c69a7d1e4ff31b4e/CommonTools/Public/Invoke-Sqlcmd2.ps1">Invoke-SqlCmd2.ps1</a></li></ul>

<p>Big thanks to Chad Miller who I think was the originator of most of these.</p>

<p>Next, I update the database to say that the library being worked on is started:</p>

<p><code>SQL
Invoke-Sqlcmd2 -ServerInstance “SQLVM1” -Database “MigrationReporting” -Query &quot;UPDATE LibraryLineage SET ValidationStarted=&#39;$((Get-Date).ToString(&quot;dd MMM yyyy hh:mm:ss&quot;))&#39; WHERE LibID=$libID&quot; -erroraction Stop
</code></p>

<p>I retrieve the main list details with Get-PnPList based on the url path (mostly because the name had some details that was more compled but you could use name too).</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell
$list = Get-PnPList -Identity $libID -erroraction Stop
$itemCount = $list.ItemCount</p>

<h1>Check list is hidden</h1>

<p>if ($list.Hidden -eq $true) {
    $isHidden = 1
}
else {
    $isHidden = 0
}
<code></code>`</p>

<p>With this, you see that I have a variable that I will use at the end to track all the right things are set. I had similar checks for minor versions being enabled and whether the search crawl was disabled.</p>

<p>The most painful part for performance was to get the ContentTypes details for the list.</p>

<p><code>PowerShell
$listCTs = Get-PnPContentType -List $libID
</code></p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure why this was quite so painful either but something I may dig further into the PnP code. I should add that this is the legacy PnP code as well because many of the other scripts are in there so this could be much more efficient now.</p>

<p>I looped through each loaded Content Type to check whether the ones I expected were there. On the first iteration, I checked it was the default value expected. Then I loaded the fields for the content type to check if the list field had been added and that the field order was correct.</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell
foreach($listCT in $listCTS) {</p>

<pre><code># Check default content type set
if ($firstValue -eq $true) {
    if ($listCT.Name -eq &quot;DefaultDocumentCT&quot;) {
        $defaultIsFirst = 1
    }
    $firstValue = $false
}
if ($listCT.Name -eq &quot;DefaultDocumentCT&quot;) {
    $defaultCTExists = 1

    # Check related records added to content types
    $listCT.Context.Load($listCT.Fields)
    $listCT.Context.ExecuteQuery()
    $matchingFields = $listCT.Fields | Where-Object {$_.Title -eq &quot;Related Records&quot;}
    if ($matchingFields.Count -gt 0) {
        $defaultCTContainsRR = 1
    }

    $fieldLinks = Get-PnPProperty -ClientObject $listCT -Property &quot;FieldLinks&quot;
    $fieldOrderCorrect = 1
    if ($fieldLinks[0] -ne &quot;FileLeafRef&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[1] -ne &quot;Title&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[2] -ne &quot;FieldOne&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[3] -ne &quot;FieldTwo&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[4] -ne &quot;FieldThree&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[5] -ne &quot;FieldFour&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[6] -ne &quot;_dlc_DocId&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[7] -ne &quot;_dlc_DocIdUrl&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[8] -ne &quot;_dlc_DocIdPersistId&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[9] -ne &quot;SelectFilename&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[10] -ne &quot;Modified&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[11] -ne &quot;Modified_x0020_By&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[12] -ne &quot;Created_x0020_By&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    if ($fieldLinks[13] -ne &quot;Created&quot;) { $fieldOrderCorrect = 0 }
    $defaultFieldOrderCorrect = $fieldOrderCorrect

}</code></pre>

<p>}
<code></code>`</p>

<p>For the fields, I needed to ensure that the mandatory fields and default values were set:</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell</p>

<h1>Check fields set to correct required fields</h1>

<p>$fields = Get-PnPField -List $list
$fieldOneValid = 0
$fieldTwoValid = 0
$fieldThreeValid = 0
$fieldFourValid = 0</p>

<p>foreach ($field in $fields) {
    if ($field.Title -eq &quot;FieldOne&quot;) {
        if ($field.Required -eq $true -and $field.DefaultValue -eq &quot;$libID&quot;) {
            $fieldOneValid = 1
        }
    }
    if ($field.Title -eq &quot;FieldTwo&quot;) {
        if ($field.Required -eq $false -and $field.DefaultValue -eq &quot;$libID&quot;) {
            $fieldTwoValid = 1
        }
    }
    if ($field.Title -eq &quot;FieldThree&quot;) {
        if ($field.Required -eq $true -and $field.DefaultValue -eq &quot;$8;#Confidential|cd929a3b-bdf0-4885-a40b-471c17bb63d8&quot;) {
            $fieldThreeValid = 1
        }
    }
    if ($field.Title -eq &quot;FieldFour&quot;) {
        if ($field.Required -eq $true) {
            $fieldFourValid = 1
        }
    }
}
<code></code>`</p>

<p>The last check was whether the main view was set up with the right fields for users.</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell</p>

<h1>Check views set</h1>

<p>$updateView = Get-PnPView -List $list -Identity &quot;All Documents&quot; -Fields &quot;DocIcon&quot;,&quot;LinkFilename&quot;,&quot;SampleDocumentType&quot;,&quot;Title&quot;,&quot;FieldOne&quot;,&quot;FieldTwo&quot;,&quot;FieldThree&quot; -erroraction Stop
$viewValid = 1
if ($updateView.ViewFields[0] -ne &quot;DocIcon&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[1] -ne &quot;LinkFilename&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[2] -ne &quot;SampleDocumentType&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[3] -ne &quot;Title&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[4] -ne &quot;FieldOne&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[5] -ne &quot;FieldTwo&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
if ($updateView.ViewFields[6] -ne &quot;FieldThree&quot;) { $viewValid = 0 }
<code></code>`</p>

<p>Each of the properties checking the values are then written into a database table for each library so it could be queried. This also formed the basis of the fix scripts that could see what was wrong and only check those records.</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell
$query = &quot;INSERT INTO [dbo].[LibraryCheck] ([LibID],[ItemCount],[IsHidden],[IsMinorVersionsEnabled],[IsNoCrawl],[IsTitleSet],[DefaultCTExists]&quot;
$query += &quot;,[SecondCTExists],[ThirdCTExists],[DefaultCTIsFirst],[DefaultCTContainsRR],[SecondCTContainsRR],[ThirdCTContainsRR],[DefaultCTFieldOrderCorrect]&quot;
$query += &quot;,[SecondCTFieldOrderCorrect],[LinkCTFieldOrderCorrect],[MNumberValid],[PNumberValid],[ProtectiveMarkingValid],[DateReceivedValid],[DocumentStatusValid]&quot;
$query += &quot;,[AESCRDocTypeValid],[AESCRRestrictedReasonValid],[WCCSubjectValid],[ViewValid]) &quot;
$query += &quot;VALUES ($mNumber,$itemCount,$isHidden,$minorVersionsEnabled,$isNoCrawl,$titleSet,$defaultCTExists&quot;
$query += &quot;,$secondCTExists,$thirdCTExists,$defaultIsFirst,$defaultCTContainsRR,$secondCTContainsRR,$thirdCTContainsRR,$defaultFieldOrderCorrect&quot;
$query += &quot;,$secondFieldOrderCorrect,$thirdCTFieldOrderCorrect,$libIdValid,$fieldOneValid,$fieldTwoValid,$fieldThreeValid,$fieldFourValid,$viewValid)&quot;</p>

<p>$query
Invoke-Sqlcmd2 -ServerInstance “VMWP-SPMIGSQL1” -Database “MigrationReporting” -Query $query
<code></code>`</p>

<p>So I had a script that analysed each of my libraries well but the problem was how long it took. On average, I was seeing each library take 33 seconds which on its own was ok, but for 65k libraries was going to be a problem. Running on a single server would take 24.8 days just to get a list of what was wrong. Even running across 10 different servers, I was looking at 2.5 days. This was not ideal.</p>

<h2>A little investigations and refactoring</h2>

<p>The first steps were to see what was taking so long. I stepped through the code and could see that the calls for Get-PnPContentType took 10-12 seconds quite often. Retrieving the list of fields was pretty slow too. I did a little testing to see if I could retrieve the fields using -Includes as well on the Get-PnPContentType call but it made the main call slower and didn&#39;t add any performance benefits.</p>

<p>My initial inclination was to rework the PowerShell to use direct CSOM calls to see if that would be faster. The logic was that I could just do what I needed to do for my code whereas the PnP calls may be doing a lot more.</p>

<p>Instead though, I started with something simpler (for me at least). When I was checking things, I would often use REST calls to check on details for a particular list which got me thinking that I could try these calls. PnP PowerShell has a lovely function called Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod that allows you to make REST calls. With these, I swapped out all the calls I was making with PnP functions with this. I moved most of them to the top of the script and was able to leave the majority of the rest of the code in place.</p>

<p><code>PowerShell
$list = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)&quot;
$listCTs = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/ContentTypes&quot;
$listFields = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/Fields&quot;
$allDocsView = Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod -Method get -Url &quot;/_api/web/GetList(&#39;/sites/TestSite/$libID&#39;)/Views?`$filter=Title%20eq%20%27All%20Documents%27&quot;
</code></p>

<p>I needed to make some changes to the foreach loops but the SchemaXml field contained the fields for the ContentTypes so I could reduce the number of calls made.</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell
foreach($listCT in $listCTs.value) {
    $listCTSchema=&quot;&quot;
    $listCTSchema  = [xml]$listCT.SchemaXml</p>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>To retrieve certain fields, I could make use of a little bit of XPath from that schema XML. Retrieving these details then no longer required any additional calls to the server.</p>

<p><code></code>`PowerShell</p>

<h1>Check related records added to content types</h1>

<pre><code>    $rr = $listCTSchema.SelectSingleNode(&quot;/ContentType/Fields/Field[@DisplayName=&#39;Related Records&#39;]&quot;)

    if ($rr -ne $null) {
        $defaultCTContainsRR = 1
    }

    $fieldLinks = $listCTSchema.SelectNodes(&quot;/ContentType/Fields/Field&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>With these in place, the average time reduced from 33 seconds down to a little over 2 seconds. Running on a single server could be down in 1.5 days or just over 3.5 hours across 10 servers. Not bad at all. Now to see if updating the fix scripts will speed things up too!</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Accessibility and SharePoint - welcome to the Immersive Reader]]></title>
        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2021-05-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard, the Immersive Reader is now available to use with pages on SharePoint Online as part of Microsoft 365 so that you can improve the accessibility of content to readers of news and other content in your tenant. In this post, I will cover the importance of the Immersive Reader and what it can do for your users.</p>

<h2>Why the Immersive Reader is important</h2>

<p>Over the years, I have had many conversations with clients looking at SharePoint and wanting to know how they can make their Intranets accessible. Many want to help ensure that all staff can access the content, regardless of any reasons why they physically or mentally may not be able to. From screen readers to considering how readable different colours are next to each other, there is plenty that can be done. SharePoint itself meets the WCAG 2.1 AA international standard in all it does but it doesn&#39;t actually make your own content in SharePoint compliant with that.</p>

<p>So up to now, there hasn&#39;t been any tool to really assist with accessibility in SharePoint but this month, Microsoft has released the Immersive Reader to SharePoint pages. This feature has been available in the Office suite and Teams for a little while but now makes it into SharePoint too. This gives users the ability to view pages in a much easier to read way, with control to increase font size, select easier to read fonts and change the background colours. These all help cater to many needs for making it easier to read.</p>

<h2>Using the Immersive Reader</h2>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader1.png"/></p>

<p>Getting started with the reader is easy as it appears at the top of the page for any reader of a page. There is no need to turn it on, it is enabled by default. Clicking on the link brings up an easy to use page with the content simplified to be easier to read with more spacing between the words and each word highlighted as it progresses.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader2.png"/></p>

<p>While the default options put the text into a simpler and more spread out state, not all accessibility needs are the same so the Immersive Reader provides additional options on the right to format how the text is rendered. Clicking on the Text option shows the options related to the text.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader3.png"/></p>

<p>As you would expect, you can easily change the font size but you can also increase the spacing between the words and pick a font that is easier to read. There are a set of ore-determined themes available for the font background to assist those who may find black on white not easy to focus on.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader4.png"/></p>

<p>In the highlighting wizard section, you can choose types of words to highlight, assisting those with more cognitive needs such as dyslexia. This can highlight types of words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs to make the content easier to understand.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader5.png"/></p>

<p>The last option provides ways to change the focus for the lines, a dictionary with pictures to help understanding of workds and finally the ability to translate the content too.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader6.png"/></p>

<p>Back in the main window, you can then get the content played out loud to listen to with each word highlighted as it goes along, making things easier to understand.</p>

<p><img alt="Accessing the Immersive Reader" src="/images/2021/05/ImmersiveReader7.png"/></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and you can control the volume too so if you just want to have the highlighting then, well, you can.</p>

<h2>Supporting accessibility</h2>

<p>Immersive Reader is a great step towards making SharePoint content open to as many people as possible. It allows access to most pages (sadly not the homepage at this time) and makes reading of content easier. Hopefully this is a first step towards making content reviewed to meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">accessibility requirements for public sector bodies</a> in the UK and it will one day be easier to flag content to content providers that they need to update. Office already has some great tools that do this for PowerPoint and also in Power Platform so fingers crossed that things will be the same in SharePoint soon.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m getting bored of some tweets. You know the ones. &quot;Here&#39;s another unsolicited message I received today&quot;. I&#39;m bored of these because in 2021, these shouldn&#39;t be needed. The unsolicited DM should not be sent. End of story. People shouldn&#39;t have to share these Tweets, because we live in a world where we respect each other, especially women. But this isn&#39;t about everyone, this about how men treat women online.</p>

<p>I will confess right now that I am not perfect. I think I have made assumptions about someone&#39;s role based on their sex. I hate myself for this and I try and learn. I know that I turn my head to a good looking woman when they walk in more than I do for men. I don&#39;t think this is right and try and stop myself. l think about how I would feel if it was me.</p>

<p><img alt="Do not be afraid to think" src="/images/2021/07/do-not-be-scared-to-think.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Empathy</h2>

<p>Next time you think about sending a message to someone you do not know, just stop a minute and think about what you would think if you received that message. What about if your mother, sister or daughter had received it, what would you say to that person? Stop and think. If you&#39;re not sure, don&#39;t send it. People will thank you. They won&#39;t find it entertaining. They might chuckle but behind your back, they will mutter about you. Don&#39;t do it.</p>

<h2>We can do better</h2>

<p>Men who are reading this, please, please don&#39;t dismiss it. Think about what you say and how you would feel. If you see others who are saying the wrong thing, then speak up. Don&#39;t be afraid of asking other people to think as well.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about being woke.</p>

<p>This is about not being a dick head.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what Microsoft Search is capable of? It has so many options for Answers but it can often be hard to see samples of this. To help with this, I have created a GitHub repo of search samples that you can use to import and get started faster</p>

<h2>How can you use the search samples?</h2>

<p>The search samples are mostly CSV files that can be imported to the admin centre. They have sets of data that can be used to populate a sample tenant with data to demonstrate or explore what is possible. Details of how to import the files, including the Floor Plan file, is in the <a href="https://github.com/kevmcdonk/MSSearch-Samples/blob/main/README.md">ReadMe</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to see how the different values look like, watch my session from Collab Days Barcelona below for demos of the different capabilities.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My thoughts and feeling from an incredible Microsoft Teams conference ]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 15th and 16th September, I spoke at my first in-person conferin almost two years and it was so incredible to be back with real people. The organising team have been through so many rollercoasters with this conference so seeing everything come together was so so heart warming. Here are my key takeaways from the event.</p>

<h2>It is all about the people</h2>

<p>I know quite how much Mark, Randy, Martin and Phillips have put into this event but if you were there and didn’t know, Mark welling up during the opening speech would have told you all you need to know. Most importantly, it was worth it. The beaming smiles and looks of awe as people took the escalator up to registration while looking down over generations of Mercedes was a sight to behold. People were enthusiastically chatting the sponsors and each other, having been starved of interaction for the last 18 months. Naturally there were still some folks who were hesitant but the goodwill kept everyone going.</p>

<p>What was clear from when I arrived the night before at the speakers event was that people were just so happy to be interacting with real people. They had depth and not just a 2D screen! I will admit that I was a little nervous that people I had only met online would not be always as engaging in real life but I was completely wrong. Everyone was friendly, open and embracing and it really showed what a strong community it is.</p>

<p>It also showed why we do things like this. Sharing to others and seeing that interest is what keeps us all going. To all the attendees, a heartfelt thank you.</p>

<h2>Hybrid can work</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects for me though was how well the hybrid aspect worked. There were some technical difficulties that were soon ironed out but I attended several talks where the presenter was remote. It didn&#39;t feel too different to the in-person sessions and you could tell that the presenter could see people there. It meant that we had a much broader range of speakers, especially those internationally based who could still present.</p>

<p>It is worth saying that it was better when the presenter was there in person and you could get the better connection with them or ask a quick question afterwards. However, the options are there for remote presenting and attending and I like the fact that people have choice. That can only be a good thing in this case.</p>

<h2>Viva is definitely a hot topic</h2>

<p>While many of these session titles were decided in the days just after Viva was announced, it was intriguing how many of the sessions referenced Viva even where it wasn&#39;t the main subject. It shouldn&#39;t have been a big surprise but it was still good to see the interest among the presenters and the good audience for the dedicated Viva sessions shows that there is definitely interest from attendees to know more.</p>

<p>On the flip side, there weren&#39;t that many vendor offerings that went big with the Viva branding but I suspect that it is still early days for that. The LMS apps on show generally hadn&#39;t defined their Viva Learning plans and the Contact Centres aren&#39;t yet talking Viva Topics. It was a Teams focused conference so there was more about the hardware on show but it will be interesting to see how this plays out at other events.</p>

<p>Talking of hardware...</p>

<h2>There&#39;s some pretty cool devices out there</h2>

<p>One thing that I was particularly interested in seeing was the new devices on show. While a blog post or video is nice, being able to see the actual things and be able to glance around makes a big difference and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. The new Bose UC headphones were simply gorgeous and did make me want to drop my QC35s a few times to give me an excuse. The Polycom solutions that would work for home office were very interesting and I can see a future in the lower end home devices to go along with the even more impressive Teams Room devices. I shouldn&#39;t forget to mention some of the Jabra headsets either with the Evolve 2 catching my attention with it&#39;s foldaway boom mic.</p>

<p>It was the cleverer devices that stole the show with AI powered cameras that could isolate each individual in a Teams meeting to give that real hybrid feel. Also the HoloLens2 and Magic Leap that Simply Videos had on display for having augmented reality meetings gave me food for thought. At one point, I saw one of their reps walking around with a headset and giving a commentary on the F1 cars at Mercedes Benz World - peak Commsverse!</p>

<h2>Governance and reporting are still important</h2>

<p>A surprise I had was how popular the sessions on governance and reporting were. These are really important for Microsoft Teams but it was telling to see the number of people attending the sessions. For me, this shows that the quick move to Teams now needs to be followed up with better governance to keep things working well and not just letting the sprawl happen.</p>

<h2>Thank you to all the organising team</h2>

<p>Finally, I can&#39;t finish without saying a massive thanks to Mark Vale, Martin Boam, Randy Chapman and Phillipa Digby for the incredible event that they put on. The heart that they put into things to make sure there was great food, brilliant swag, engaging speakers, intriguing sponsors and just the best venue showed their passion for the community. Without people like those four, we would not be able to have anywhere near the fun and interest we have.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aligning your organisational goals with your employees own]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-to-improve-employee-experience-by-aligning-peoples-work-with-team-goals-and-company-mission/">Microsoft announced</a> that they were acquiring Ally.IO, an OKR company. Now Microsoft has made quite a few acquisitions over the years but what was interesting about this one was that it announced as the service that would power the next Viva module. It had been heavily hinted that the first four pillars (Connections, Topics, Insights and Learning) would not be the last ones and here it is, the focus for the next release.</p>

<p>Ally.IO focuses on OKRs or Objective and Key Results which are ways to track the aims of an organisation from the top and connect those to the objectives of the employees. It fits with Microsoft Viva as employees feel more engaged when they understand their purpose within an organisation, understand what they need to do to help an organisation succeed. Ally.IO supports this by making clear that alignment from top to bottom and also help make it clear what employees need to do to succeed themselves. Purpose and empowerment are two of Glint&#39;s <a href="https://www.glintinc.com/blog/the-elements-of-people-success/">elements of people success</a> and helps to form the full Employee Experience Platform from Microsoft.</p>

<p>In this blog, I&#39;ll run through my initial experiences with the trial that you can set up from the <a href="https://ally.io/">Ally.IO site</a>. If you would like more info on what OKRs are and how they fit in the world of Performance Management, Josh Bersin has a great post about it on his <a href="https://joshbersin.com/2021/10/microsoft-doubles-down-on-viva-employee-goals-with-ally-acquisition/">blog site</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The place to get started is by signing up for a trial on the <a href="https://ally.io/">Ally.IO site</a>. At the time of writing, you can get a 14 day trial from the main site ahead of the full pricing of $7 per user per month.</p>

<p><img alt="Set up a trial" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-01.png"/></p>

<p>Once set up, having validated your email, you are guided to follow a tour for setting up things from the start. The platform is easy to use and easy to understand from the off. As well as the tour, you are given recommended next steps to get moving, including how to build your objectives.</p>

<p><img alt="Getting started" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-02.png"/><img alt="Guide on what to do next" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-03.png"/></p>

<h2>Starting with objectives</h2>

<p>The aim is to get started with your objectives at an organisation level, aligning those to your company purpose. A big obvious button called New Objective guides the new user on how to get going. A slide out panel on the right gives an obvious set of properties to fill out.</p>

<p><img alt="Adding an objective" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-04.png"/></p>

<p>Some people may be unsure about the sort of objectives to get started with so there is a set of sample objectives to give you a nudge on the sort of thing to add. These are grouped together into different types of objectives for different departments.</p>

<p><img alt="Sample objectives" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-05.png"/></p>

<p>The magic then starts when you can add more linked to this objective:</p>

<ul><li>Parent objective</li><li>Child objectives</li><li>Key results</li><li>Projects</li></ul>

<p>The key results add the focus of having real measures to align to your objectives. These can be set manually or linked up to other systems such as Azure Dev Ops, Excel Online, Github, Jira and many more. This links up your goal to the systems that you use, to the systems where the work you are doing takes place.</p>

<p><img alt="Key results as manual or from a system" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-07.png"/></p>

<h2>Where does the Microsoft bit come in?</h2>

<p>OK, you may be looking and wondering why Microsoft decided to bring this in. Ally.IO actually already has some integration and not just with the Key results mentioned above. It can bring your OKRs and your organisations OKRs into your flow of work, right there in Microsoft Teams (or Slack or Discord or a few others).</p>

<p><img alt="Integrations" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-08.png"/></p>

<p>For Teams, the integration brings an app that can be pinned like other Teams Apps and shows you the OKRs for you and for the org. These tabs can be added to your own teams as well as the main app so you could even have your department&#39;s objectives aligned with your department team.</p>

<p><img alt="Integrations" src="/images/2021/10/AllyIO-09.png"/></p>

<p>Not only that but you can also chat to the bot if you want to...well...it just seems to link to the OKRs at the moment but hopefully this will expand!</p>

<h2>My thoughts</h2>

<p>These are my thoughts after a few hours of playing around with the trial so these opinions may change. I have tried using OKRs with my team at previous organisations but never had the tools in place to make it happen. The magic here is that alignment from top to bottom and to have it data driven as well. Connecting in with your different systems to be metric driven for your objectives and to make it easier to get those as consistent results.</p>

<p>Bringing in a system to track these makes it far more likely that people will engage on a regular basis. This isn&#39;t about that forgotten set of notes that is only reviewed once a year at a rushed appraisal, this is about regular updates linked to what you do on a day to day basis. This will connect up to the wider purpose of an organisation and connect those together from top to bottom.</p>

<p>If I had a small grumble, the cost of $7 per user for a system that could only be used on an occasional basis and so may scare some off, especially for larger scales. Hopefully a better link up with the other Viva licenses if it comes will improves this.</p>

<p>The platform is simple to use and already works in Teams so will align well with the other Viva pillars. There are also key integrations with other services, both Microsoft and third party ones, once again like the other Viva pllars. It fills a gap in the EXP and so should be seen as another great enhancement for organisations.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing my role as Viva Transformer in the Viva Explorers]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“In 2022, a crack community unit was sent to Microsoft for some contracts that they couldn’t commit. These people promptly got together, not escaping from Teams, to explore the world of Microsoft Viva. Today, still wanted by the community they serve, they survive as collaborators of fortune. If you have an employee experience problem, if no-one else can help and, wherever you can find them…maybe you can hear from the Viva Explorers.”</p>

<p>Thanks to the great mind of Lesley Crook (and with apologies to the A-Team), a group of community minded people has come together to help you understand the world of Microsoft Viva. You can read the tale on the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-community-blog/join-vivaexplorers-in-an-empathic-hybrid-workplace/ba-p/3280353">Tech Community blog</a> but this post is about the part that I play - the Viva Transformer.</p>

<p>Transformation is such a key part of any journey to new ideas and employee experience with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva">Microsoft Viva</a> is no different. Turning on the technology is only part of the story and in this post, I will talk about some of the high level areas to consider when helping to transform the organisation with adoption and change management. In my current role as head of practice for modern workplace at CPS, we always include change and adoption plans so that we know that things will be of benefit and understood by staff. So what do you need for rolling out Viva at your organisation?</p>

<h2>Start with Why</h2>

<p>So you’ve decided that you are rolling out Viva. Great, good plan. Except you might have missed something. Have you worked out why? Not only that but have you backed up that reason by speaking with staff? Can you align the different areas within Viva specific challenges that have been raised by employees? This is where you need to start.</p>

<p>If you already have an annual staff survey or are taking pulse surveys with a tool like <a href="https://www.glintinc.com/blog/an-employees-guide-to-glint-surveys/">Glint</a>. You may already have some insight into the challenges being faced. You may have a very vocal employee forum or be taking feedback from regular town halls. Make sure that this feedback is broad and caters for the introverts and quieter personalities in your organisation as well as the louder voices that often emerge. Take some of the key points and make sure that you drill a little deeper to make sure that you are getting to the right root of the problem.</p>

<p>One way to consider these is to construct these into areas around the employee lifecycle. The lifecycle starts as soon as someone starts looking at a company, moves through hiring and the all important onboarding. It considers how you engage people with the organisation and each other, putting in place all that people need to perform and allow them to grow within the organisation. Finally, there will always be a point where people depart and considers how you ensure a good farewell that leaves a lasting impression to pass on to others or to encourage a return one day.</p>

<p><img alt="Employee Lifecycle" src="/images/2022/04/EmployeeLifecycle.jpeg"/></p>

<h2>What do you implement?</h2>

<p>When it comes to implementations for the Employee Experience, much depends on what you are implementing. The Viva Explorers will be sharing plenty on how to implement Viva with the technical details so in this post I’m going to consider more what you need to transform. If you are have followed the whys above, you have a great backlog of items but what do you do first? What is the priority?</p>

<p>To establish these, the first thing to set up is an Employee Experience Working Group. These will have a group of key stakeholders that can drive change from the top along with key implementers which can make that change happen. There are many ways to implement these that I will go into in future blog posts but some of the key elements are:</p>

<pre><code>• Transparent views for the whole organisation around what is being done
• Mechanisms for feedback to be taken and addressed
• Agreement on how priorities are determined
• Clear guidance on current priorities</code></pre>

<p>There will often be a lot of different areas that need addressing at once but either not enough budget or not enough time to address all at once. Clearly tracking and agreeing the priorities helps employees understand what is coming and can also help to manage the amount of change in one go. It provides a consistent message to employees and helps deliver to completion.</p>

<h2>How do you know you have succeeded?</h2>

<p>Implementing initiatives to improve the employee experience is great but only if they succeed in improving the experience. Having clear criteria for success and KPIs to measure how close to that enables clear and transparent goals that all can see. These will keep all involved but also help to keep the organisation focused on delivering those goals.plus, the great news is that Viva has ways to help you with this.</p>

<p>Through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/introduction">Viva Insights</a>, you can look at evidence based measures to support your initiatives. Looking to reduce burnout for staff? Look at hours spent outside of core hours or percentage of back to back meetings. Looking to increase cross departmental engagement to support innovation? Measure the connections taking place in Teams and Outlook through meetings, calls, chats and emails. Don’t like the pre-canned reports? No problems, build your own. Want to integrate absence data? No problems, build out reports with Power BI.</p>

<p>Viva Insights gives your leaders and managers the support needed to understand their employees and what is influencing them. It also supports those insights with recommendations on what can be done to improve that as well with links to key reports and more articles in the inspiration library.</p>

<p>It’s not just insights though, there is also <a href="https://ally.io">Ally.IO</a> (which will hopefully have a Viva name soon!) that helps to give data driven objectives for OKRs (Objective Key Results). These help people understand their purpose for the organisation as it aligns objectives from top to bottom but it also supports them with real data. It allows people to hook their Key Results as metrics with databases and tables providing the actual data to support the OKRs and the continuous feedback reviews.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There is so much more to talk about with transforming the employee experience with Viva and I’m looking forward to being able to share that with you as part of the Viva Explorers. Between us, we cover so many different perspectives, from the technical to the cultural, the why you should to the what you should to the how you could. We will be sharing but also listening to your journeys and helping to feedback to Microsoft along the way.
Why do I do this? I want this focus on employees at the centre to benefit as organisations as possible and therefore help as many people as possible. Making change happen the right way is what makes transformations happen and stick which is where the true magic happen. Look out for more coming from the Viva Explorers soon...</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why it is about more than just tech]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beautiful city, great speakers, all the Microsoft content, plenty of drinks - that is the way to spend a couple of days. At the start of June, I was one of the over one thousand people who attended the Scottish Summit in Glasgow, a Microsoft Community event that has been running for several years now but was the first year back in person since the start of the pandemic. Here are a few of my thoughts as I head back home.</p>

<h2>The importance of accessibility for all</h2>

<p>It is always important as you come away from an event like the <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com">Scottish Summit</a> to reflect and work out what it will mean to you afterwards, what you have taken away from it. The biggest thing for me was easy - the importance of accessibility and making life easier for everyone, not just must people. The opening keynote was one of the most special I have ever seen as <a href="https://twitter.com/cmcginley">Connell McGinley</a> spoke of his story as a deaf person in IT. The things that we take for granted like making a call or knowing when you are being asked a question suddenly become very different. One point that hit home is the ease at which we can accidentally exclude people - Connell was chosen as the person who sat in the data centre early in his career as the noise of the fan was thought to not affect him. It is these sort of exclusions and assumptions that we should all challenge in our selves.</p>

<p>The fact that Connell can now be so involved in IT is a huge win for the power of technology tools now as Microsoft Teams and captioning helps to make it more seamless for all to be involved. Small changes to our habits, enabled by the tech that we use can make a much bigger difference for others and is something we should all try. The applause for the session was lead by <a href="https://twitter.com/donaSarkar">Dona Sarkar</a> who asked us all to use the British Sign Language applause with our hands raised in the air and twisted, almost jazz hands style. The site of the crowd with their hands up was just beautiful and the number of people that continued to do that during the two days of the summit was inspiring.</p>

<p>The accessibility theme continued through the rest of the conference with many sessions having sign language interpreters to make them available to all. There was plenty of tech sessions too, covering Power Platform, Microsoft 365, Dynamics and Azure. However, it was the non-tech sessions that I really took a lot away from, especially the panel sessions organised by Microsoft up on the 9th floor. The mental health session was incredibly open and the panellists shared some truly horrific stories of how they have been treated and the journeys they have been through. It was so helpful to not only remind me of things to do but to also learn more about the right and wrong things to do. I took away the most important things were to speak to people with mental health struggles, not to make assumptions about how they want to be treated and to try not to make statements that could be a trigger. <a href="https://twitter.com/AzureRory">Rory Neary</a> also gave a fantastic session on his own mental health challenges and his own reminders not to blame the trigger itself. Looking forward to continue the discussion on mental health as Rory joins <a href="https://www.twitter.com">CPS</a> and sharing with others the tools and techniques that Dona Sarkar talked about in <a href="https://youtu.be/uewTShNre7k">her closing keynote</a> on how to discuss mental health at work.</p>

<h2>Talks and talking</h2>

<p>For the tech sessions, I will be honest that I missed many of the ones that I had intended to see. Why? Because I was chatting with people too much! Chatting about Viva, chatting about licensing (yes really) and an awful lot of chatting about life. People often talk about finding your tribe and that is what these events feel like. The chance to meet that virtual community that you have found in real life and find out that they are like that in real life too. It is hard to name all the people I enjoyed chatting with but I would like to mention <a href="https://twitter.com/DamoBird365">Damien Bird</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZaidZaim2k">Zaid Zaim</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mirrortears">Kathrin Borchert</a> because I had either not met them or only briefly met them before and they were just the loveliest people. Real events open up the circle of people you meet and I truly hope that stays true with these three as well as the other awesome people I get to be with.</p>

<p>As well as nattering and building connections, I did also have the chance to be involved in three sessions. These were all sessions that I had run with others virtually in some way but this was the first time we&#39;d tried in person. What was great was how interactive they were and how we managed to get the audience interaction running nicely with them. I am a big believer in the virtual/hybrid world and the enablement that it brings and so it&#39;s less that we should all move to in-person and more that we should look more at those things and how we can do it more in the virtual space. Being there keeps you present so looking at your meetings and sessions, think about how you can disconnect from your other distractions. Think about how you can feed those cues to the people speaking without distracting too . Think about engaging with them at the right times as well. As a coordinator, think about giving people time while also making sure they connect to it. Realise that while there may be focus on one person, there are others to look at too. As a speaker, think about how you can move around and change the focus to keep the audience interested - swap from faces to presentations to other screens. It was great to be able to stand in front of others and I look forward to doing more but I also want to take that learning to use virtually too.</p>

<p>Learning from how others speak as well was important. The different styles and seeing how the audience responded to those different styles. People rarely leave on their camera when watching virtual events but you can see the reactions and what engages people far more in person. My simplified views often take over in my head and think that all talks need to be exciting and energetic throughout but watching how others pace their sessions, bring in points to think about alongside sharing specific things, change up and down the sort of things that are being shown. All of these really help with how I can become a better speaker and a better consultant as well.</p>

<p>As the recordings of some of these sessions become available, I will update this post with links.</p>

<h2>The informal fun (as opposed to the formal fun)</h2>

<p>I can&#39;t not mention the socialising. I feel like we may have helped fund Brewdog in Glasgow for the rest of the summer with the amount we were there but it was amazing to have big groups that you could just float about and chat to familiar faces. People are so friendly and welcoming at these events and open to new faces. I wrote previously about how hard it can be when you see familiar faces but the groups at these events are incredible so get chatting with them, make those connections and you never know where it will take you. The stories I heard over the last few days of new roles happening because of people knowing each other and building those relationships are a great way to justify the fun that you get to have to the poor family who are left behind as we travel to these events. I would like to say a big thank you to my wife and mother-in-law because I could not do things like this without their backing.</p>

<p><img alt="One of the many visits to Brewdog - large group of people outside the Brewdog bar in Glasgow" src="/images/2022/06/ScottishSummitSocialising.jpg"/></p>

<p>Back on the socialising, it seems a suitable point to end on a celebration. The highlight of many of these events has become the infamous pub quiz run by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbibby">Andrew Bibby</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tassyja">Tricia Sinclair</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KeeganMumInTech">Keegan Stanton</a> and under the supreme leadership of <a href="https://twitter.com/SharePoint_Zoe">Zoe Wilson</a>, our team (Haggis and Chips) were champions! Not a bad way to round off a tiring but rewarding, inspiring and fun few days in Scotland.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aligning Viva to more than HR?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 16 June, Microsoft dropped a surprise on us - a brand new Viva pillar. Viva Sales has allows employees to enter CRM data, whatever your CRM and powered by AI. With nudges and hints to help you do the right thing, it will truly power a more productive and effective sales force (whether with Salesforce, Dynamics or something else). What is more interesting though is what this means to the future of Viva.</p>

<h2>What is Viva?</h2>

<p>Hopefully everyone reading this knows about <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva">Microsoft Viva</a> but, just in case, it is the
Employee experience platform from Microsoft that puts the employee at the centre. It is formed of multiple pillars but all of this are centred around Teams as the platform so you can use all of them in your flow of work through Teams that must of us are already familiar with.</p>

<p>The pillars are currently:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/connections">Viva Connections</a> - connecting employees to the organisation, to each other and to the tools they need to get their job done</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/insights">Viva Insights</a> - providing personal productivity and leadership insights</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/topics">Viva Topics</a> - providing the right knowledge to the right people at the right time</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/learning">Viva Learning</a> - helping employees learn in their flow of work</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/goals">Viva Goals</a> - aligning culture and strategy throughout the organisation with OKRs</li></ul>

<p>And now Viva Sales fits into these pillars too. There has been a seventh pillar announced as well with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-viva/viva-and-glint">Glint</a> due to be integrated into Viva to capture pulse surveys from employees, integrating the insights with what employees are saying.</p>

<p>The common thread to these tools, as well as being employee focused, is that they bring AI power to them to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, Viva Topics will automatically extract knowledge topics from across your Microsoft 365 estate and Viva Learning will suggest courses from across your LMSs based on what courses you have taken and what people around you are looking at.</p>

<p>The other common thread is that they connect into other platforms, this isn’t just a Microsoft thing.</p>

<ul><li>Viva Connections has the dashboard which means you can easily bring live data to your digital workplace hub from any platform with an API</li><li>Viva Insights links in with Headspace and you can align your data through Power BI with any other data sources</li><li>Viva Topics will soon be able to index data from any other system with an API to inject your knowledge from services like Salesforce and ServiceNow</li><li>Viva Learning pulls from all your LMS platforms to give you one place for your learning content and with playlists across those</li><li>Viva Goals can power your key results from tools such as Jira, Asana, Google Sheets and more</li><li>Viva Sales will be able to update your CRM whether it is Dynamics, Salesforce or something else</li></ul>

<p>This common thread neatly positions Viva at the centre of your Digital Workplace.</p>

<h2>Tell me more about this Viva Sales</h2>

<p>The focus of Viva Sales is around making it easier for those updating their CRM systems. Whether you are in sales or pre-sales, it can be a pain making sure that you capture updates into your CRM as you have those conversations with your clients and clients-to-be. Viva Sales aims to improve that by embedding into all the Office tools. This isn’t just a plug-in that brings things to one place though. It will use AI to make suggestions and nudges so that if you promised a client something, it will log that against that client and remind you. It will make sure that those leads are followed up. It will change the world!</p>

<p>Ok, we must wait to see more details as the only information released so far is the video below but it gives you a great idea. Having this working regardless of your CRM will be very compelling as well.</p>

<h2>How does Viva Sales change things?</h2>

<p>Here is the interesting and fundamental question that arises with the announcement of Viva Sales. This feels like a pivot in where Viva is going. Some on social media have spoken about Viva being an HR tool (I even heard the phrase and onboarding told) but it has always been more than that. The introduction of a sales oriented product suggests a move towards more role oriented products that suit particular employees more than others.</p>

<p>Providing specific solutions to different areas of an organisation but with a common look and with the same AI powered goodness that also allows for more integration from other platforms that organisations are using feels like the new direction that Viva is expanding into. I have often spoken about Viva as a brand rather than a product and this expansion fulfils that further. The success of the recognition for the brand is taking off and Microsoft has recognised that and is building on that success.</p>

<h2>Viva as the end user Microsoft Graph</h2>

<p>This positioning of Viva as a brand feels like the positioning of it as the broader way of the different teams within Microsoft to provide a consistent message. Those close to Microsoft often talk of them “shipping the org chart” and having products competing because teams are competing for attention at Microsoft. A great example is where Microsoft 365 and Dynamics have in the past released similar sounding services and consuls rants and the MVP community are left fielding the “what should I use when” conversation. What this move to Viva Sales shows is not only are those teams working closer together than ever before, with the relationship here between Dynamics and Teams being particularly encouraging, but that there is that aim for that consistent approach externally. This will make life a lot easier for the average user.</p>

<p>This approach follows what the Microsoft Graph has done already. It has become that consistent API across many diverse and fragmented APIs for each product. For the most part, when you learn how it works with one platform, it is consistent with all the others under it - <a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">Darrel Miller</a> talks about this in a recent <a href="https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-j2wx4-123d309">Microsoft 365 Developer podcast episode</a>.</p>

<p>By becoming the common user interface for these different services and building this into Microsoft Teams, the most commonly used service, Viva becomes the common end user tool across all the services to get things done. Users will know that they connect other platforms into it without learning new ways so much and will get the AI power to make it easy to do the right thing.</p>

<h2>What will we see next?</h2>

<p>We already know that the Glint integration will happen into Viva but what else? <a href="https://twitter.com/Lesley_wolan">Lesley Crook</a> has a <a href="https://vivavisionary.uk/2022/06/16/hot-off-the-viva-press/">great blog post</a> and suggests that ERP could be next. I hope that our Viva Explorer sessions on the battle between <a href="https://youtu.be/YbRNduoEaA0">Dynamics HR and Viva</a> will lead to more integration for HR self service into Viva, especially around training. Service Desk could benefit from that AI power to suggest what your issue is whatever your background. The education market could also be powered by that magic, connecting in the different learning and course management systems consistently. There is a lot of potential to come.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why you would consider implementing Viva Goals]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the general availability of Viva Goals at the start of August 2022, many people have been wondering what the benefits are. The honest answer is that the majority are to do with the OKR (Objective Key Result) framework that Viva Goals helps organisations to implement it but the tools are just part of the equation. This blog post looks into some of the challenges that OKRs along with Viva Goals look to address. Future posts will look into:</p>

<ul><li>The what of Viva Goals - covering what OKRs are and how Viva Goals supports these across your organisation</li><li>The how of Viva Goals - how you can set up Viva Goals and how it can transform your organisation</li></ul>

<h2>The super powers of OKRs</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s start with some questions, some of which will be relevant to individuals, some to departments and some to the whole organisation.</p>

<ul><li>Do you start work on a Monday morning and wonder why you are doing what you do?</li><li>Are you trying to help change the direction of your organisation?</li><li>Does your organisation have a clearly set strategy that the organisation understands?</li><li>Do you know how aligned people are to that strategy?</li><li>Are team or department siloes causing repeated work and miscommunication?</li><li>Do you find yourself doing the same thing day in, day out?</li><li>Are you being challenged in your role?</li></ul>

<p>The super powers of OKRs can help you understand how all these can be addressed.</p>

<ul><li>Focus</li><li>Alignment</li><li>Tracking</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Stretch</li></ul>

<p>These take into account the areas that OKRs used across an organisation can help drive value but you may target different areas at different rates as well, especially for larger organisations. The more areas that you have onboard, the more alignment and focus you will have.</p>

<h2>Focus and alignment</h2>

<p>Do you remember last Monday morning? Perhaps you had a long weekend with the kids, fixing up the house the way you want it or were out making shapes at a festival. Monday morning may have felt painful and so turning on your PC/Mac may have kicked off that familiar feeling. What do I have to do today? Maybe you had a list or just went to your calendar to check what was going on. But did you know why? Were you just going through the motions with no real feeling as to how these tasks play into the wider picture of your department or whole organisation.</p>

<p>OKRs provide a set of hierarchical objectives from the top to all employees. It allows you to align what you are doing with what you are meant to be doing and what the organisation is trying to achieve. It helps you look at new ideas you may have and to compare them to the key areas of focus to see if they link in with other&#39;s ideas.</p>

<p>To drive a specific focus, organisation&#39;s should look to focus on just 3-5 goals per quarter so that employees are not pulled in many different directions at the same time. This helps to make sure that things get done rather than providing different pulls from different competing goals across different areas.</p>

<p>I have seen this in action myself. At a previous organisation, a new head of technology joined. In his first two months, he outlined his seven areas of focus along with a set of metrics that would be used to measure each one. Sadly, my memory of most of them has long faded but I remember that one was around the virtualisation of the server estate and another about getting a more service oriented approach to IT Teams (that were far more used to just getting an email and hoping they got round to it eventually in many cases). Each area was set a target to achieve and this was tracked on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Many conversations were had about initiatives that were wanted to start but if they didn&#39;t align to one of the pillars then there was no traction. This brought the focus across all but also meant that people aligned what was needed to these pillars. For example, if we felt that the system we were developing could be more efficient, we could introduce the aim to reduce CPU cycles which would improve the virtualisation estate. It helped us align our own initiatives to those of the organisation and provide the focus for the value that should be achieved.</p>

<h2>Tracking</h2>

<p>While many organisation&#39;s may have their set of values and it may be well understood, these will often not stay as a centre of focus without understanding how things are going. The power of tracking means that not only is the focus and alignment to an organisation&#39;s strategy is understood but exactly what should be achieved at any point of time to achieve the strategy.</p>

<p>OKRs provide this through the key result portion of the OKR, providing explicit values that can be tracked over time to determine if an objective has been met or not. This also allows tracking to see if the objective is on track to be met or not as well.</p>

<p>The tracking at a deeper level in the organisation also allows managers and employees to have a more regular conversation around what they are achieving. This reduces the panic of ticking off all objectives at the end of the year and helps to steer a more realistic approach to objectives throughout the year. This keeps employees engaged with their objectives and prevents them becoming a side show to their main role while they become disengaged with ongoing improvement.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered what on earth another department actually does? Whether you are in operations and just think marketing fluff about sending silly social media posts or you are in marketing and wonder why sales never make anything of the leads you generate, siloes can cause big problems to a focused organisation.</p>

<p>OKRs are designed to be as transparent as possible so that you understand everyone else&#39;s objectives as well as your own. This means you can find out what the focus of another team is and understand why they may not be reacting so quickly to your requests. It means that you can see if other teams are also looking at the same objectives as you to help build shared objectives.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful things I heard at the last MVP Summit was two teams talking about having a shared OKR. It was nothing to do with Viva or Viva Goals but it demonstrated immediately to me that the common siloes that often appear at large organisation&#39;s like Microsoft were being broken down by these two teams. They were pulling in the same direction and people working with them would see that togetherness over time.</p>

<h2>Stretch</h2>

<p>There is a future post in the making that outlines the difference between KPIs and OKRs but one key aim of OKRs is to stretch everyone - individual employees, teams, departments and the organisation as a whole. If people are achieving their OKRs completely on a regular basis then they are not stretching themselves enough. The intention should be to push themselves and challenge themselves to be able to do more.</p>

<p>Naturally, this should be within reason and having no-one ever able to achieve anything. The stretch should be achievable but not unrealistic or people will drift away. It should make things interesting and drive more achievement.</p>

<h2>Learning more about the why</h2>

<p>If these examples have whet your appetite to hear more, do check out the book Measure What Matters by John Doerr. John was fundamental to getting OKRs to drive change at Google from the very early days. There are some great examples such as the change of measuring success for YouTube from number of videos to number of minutes watched, changing behaviour across the different teams and with the users themselves.</p>

<p>OKRs, when implemented well, can provide such a powerful way of keeping people engaged with their achievements and their job as a whole. They can help individuals understand their Monday mornings and help organisation&#39;s drive change where needed.</p>

        <id>https://www.mcd79.com/undefined</id>
        <link href="https://www.mcd79.com/undefined"/>
        <updated>2023-01-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying out the Syntex PAYG model in public preview]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Ignite last year, SharePoint Syntex became Microsoft Syntex and there were a whole load of new announcements including things like Archival, Backup, bulk translation and digital signatures, all coming to Syntex. One of the smaller updates announced has now come into public preview and that is a change to the cost model with Pay As You Go pricing.</p>

<h2>What is meant by Pay As You Go pricing?</h2>

<p>With the new Microsoft Syntex billing model, instead of paying per user as the current model requires, you are billed per use of Syntex. In terms of content processing, this means that each document that is analysed, you will have a charge for each document. This means that if you only occasionally use Syntex, your bills will go down significantly but this also allows you to try out Syntex at a low cost too.</p>

<p>During the public preview, there is not cost at all for the document processing so this is an even better time to try Syntex out in your environments. At the time of writing, there is no confirmation on when the preview will end or what the cost will be at the end of the preview.</p>

<h2>What can you do with Syntex?</h2>

<p>The area I was interested in looking at was around the content processing. Syntex can process text related Office documents or images using two different engines. There is a <img alt="lot of material on Microsoft Learn" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/contentunderstanding/syntex-overview"/> around Syntex so I won&#39;t repeat that here. What I wanted to look at was one of the pre-built models that is designed for receipt processing.</p>

<p>This model requires no initial set up and machine teaching - that work has already been done by Microsoft. Instead, you can switch it on and point it at your documents in a SharePoint library and have it extract the default content.</p>

<h2>Why would you use this?</h2>

<p>For larger organisations, they will usually already have an expenses system such as SAP Concur that has image processing to extract information from receipts. However, smaller organisations may find it useful to process receipts automatically to reduce the pain of submitting expenses, using mobile devices to scan them and Power Automate to trigger an approval process.</p>

<p>There may be other, simpler scenarios where you want to process a set of receipts for other reasons such as capturing which vendors produce the most litter in an area. The bigger aim is to demonstrate how Syntex can be used to automate manual tasks.</p>

<h2>Sharing how it works</h2>

<p>I have recorded a video showing how it can be set up and the receipt model being put into place.</p>

<p>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wxwvdZphgs&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>Microsoft Syntex adoption should increase dramatically with the use of this new model as it greatly simplifies the costs and gives organisation more control. However, the real proof will be what the costs actually are as a high cost will put off larger scale use of Syntex for a large organisation. Time will tell whether this easier adoption leads to a longer usage pattern but I certainly hope that it does.</p>
